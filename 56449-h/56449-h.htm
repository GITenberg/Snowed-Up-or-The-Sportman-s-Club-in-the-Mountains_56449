<span class="small">A DISPUTE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">“Did</span> you ever hear tell of sich a thing afore,
Zack?”</p>

<p>“I never did in all my born days&mdash;never! The
idee of this little snipe comin’ out here, fresh from
the States, an’ tellin’ a man like me, what’s done
nothin’ but guide wagon-trains acrosst the prairie
fur the last ten years&mdash;the idee of his tellin’ me
that I am losin’ the hul kit an’ bilin’ of you, an’
that I am doin’ it a purpose! I say it’s ridikilis,
an’ I won’t stand it. Here, Sile, hold my gun till
I make him chaw them words of his’n!”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>“You are very much mistaken in me, my friend,”
replied a calm voice, which contrasted strangely
with the excited guide’s insolent tones. “I may
be fresh from the States, but I have seen more of
prairie life than you seem to imagine. At any
rate, I know enough about it to be sure that you are
not on the road to the Fort.”</p>

<p>This conversation took place one bright morning,
between our old friend Archie Winters, and two
rough looking frontiersmen, who answered to the
names of Zack and Silas. The latter stood leaning
on his rifle, and glaring down at the boy before him
as if he meant to destroy him by the angry glances
from his eyes, while Zack was rolling up his sleeves
and making other demonstrations which showed a
desire on his part to fight somebody. Close by
Archie’s side were his two inseparable companions,
Fred Craven and Eugene Gaylord, who sat in their
saddles, being mounted on the same horses they
had ridden from Salt Lake City to Fort Bolton.
Eugene held Archie’s old horse by the bridle, while
Archie’s attention was about equally divided between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the two trappers and a small bay steed, with
black points and a white star in his forehead, to
which he was clinging with both hands. The horse
bore Archie’s saddle strapped firmly on his back,
and was kept in partial subjection by a rawhide
lasso, which was twisted tightly about his lower jaw,
the ends being passed over the animal’s neck and
around the horn of the saddle to serve as a bridle.
Like Roderick and King James, this horse had a
history which shall be related in due time.</p>

<p>Around this group which we have described were
gathered a dozen or more emigrants, men, women
and children, who waited impatiently to hear what
would be said next, and looked first at the guides
and then at Archie, as if trying to discover something
in their faces that would aid them in deciding
between the disputants. A little distance away
stood two wagons, the mules and oxen harnessed
and yoked and ready to start; but there was a wide
difference of opinion between Archie and the guides
on a matter that was of vital importance to the emigrants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and they could not think of resuming their
journey until it had been settled.</p>

<p>Having made his preparations for a pugilistic
encounter, with as much care and deliberation as
he would have exhibited had he been about to
measure strength with a person of his own stature
and weight, Zack once more addressed himself to
Archie.</p>

<p>“We was all quiet an’ peaceable like till you
come,” said he; “but since you dropped down
amongst us all of a sudden, like you had come from
the clouds, an’ without nobody’s askin’ you to
come, thar’s been a rumpus goin’ on the hul time.”</p>

<p>“The rumpus, as you call it, was all raised by
you,” returned Archie. “You’ve had a good
many remarks to make about us, but we have
kept silent.”</p>

<p>“Now you can jest toddle off about your business,
if you’ve got any,” coutinued Zack, “or take
what follows. I haint agoin’ to waste no time a
waitin’ on you, nuther.”</p>

<p>“We have business,” answered Archie, “but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
are in no great hurry to attend to it. The prairie
is as free to us as it is to you, and when we get tired
of staying here, we’re going to Fort Bolton.”</p>

<p>“So be we,” said Zack.</p>

<p>“How far do you call it from here?” asked
Archie.</p>

<p>“A matter of thirty miles, mebbe.”</p>

<p>“And which way?”</p>

<p>“Off thar,” said Zack, extending his arm toward
the north-west.</p>

<p>“Well, I say it is off <i>there</i>,” replied Archie,
pointing in just the opposite direction, “and distant
about three days’ journey. I ought to know, for I
have just come from there.”</p>

<p>“What brought you so far away from the Fort?”
asked one of the emigrants.</p>

<p>“As we told you last night, we have been following
a drove of wild horses, trying to catch one of
them.”</p>

<p>“An’ as <i>we</i> told you last night, that’s a likely
story,” said Zack, glancing at Silas, who nodded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
assent. “You’re purty lookin’ fellers to ketch a
wild hoss, haint you now!”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s the horse, any how,” returned
Archie, jerking his thumb over his shoulder toward
the animal he was holding. “If you don’t believe
he is wild, just put yourself within reach of his
heels, if you dare. We followed the drove he was
in for three days and more, and that’s what brought
us so far from the Fort.”</p>

<p>“An’ that’s how you come to be teetotally turned
round an’ lost,” added Zack. “You fellers can do
as you like about it, but I tell you that if you foller
them young cubs you’ll never see Fort Bolton
the longest day you live.”</p>

<p>This last remark was called forth by a movement
on the part of the emigrants, who, in response to a
sign from one of their number, drew a little apart
to hold a consultation. Their actions led Zack to
mistrust that they were on the point of deciding
against him, and this seemed to increase the feelings
of animosity which, for some unaccountable reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
he had shown toward Archie and his friends ever
since they first appeared in the emigrant camp.</p>

<p>“If they do go with you I’ll allow they won’t
have much to foller,” said Zack, in savage tones,
“cause I’ll wallop you till thar ain’t nothing left
of you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you should want to do that,”
answered Archie. “These people are nothing to
you, and it can make no difference to you whether
they go your way or mine.”</p>

<p>“Then what odds does it make to you?” demanded
Silas.</p>

<p>“None whatever. They told us they wanted to
go to Bolton, and as we were going right there we
offered to show them the way.”</p>

<p>“More like you want to show ’em the way to
some place in the mountains whar you can rob ’em,”
snapped Zack.</p>

<p>“O, come now,” returned Archie, “that’s rather
too far-fetched. I’ve seen whole families composed
of such as you. There are some of them in irons
now at the Fort.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” demanded Zack.</p>

<p>“I mean that there are some men of your calling
in irons now in Fort Bolton,” repeated Archie, not
in the least terrified by the expression of almost
ungovernable fury which settled on the man’s face.
“That’s what I mean. Have a care,” he added, as
Zack dashed his hat upon the ground with an
angry exclamation and started fiercely toward him.
“I have a friend here who will not see me imposed
upon.”</p>

<p>As Archie spoke he swung himself around beside
the horse he was holding, which, believing no doubt
that the boy was about to mount him, turned
swiftly, thus presenting his heels toward the advancing
guide, who halted very suddenly.</p>

<p>“He knows how to handle his feet,” continued
Archie, “and I believe he can kick your hat off
your head the first time trying. Suppose you put
it on and let him make the attempt.”</p>

<p>Zack did not see fit to accept this proposition,
and neither did he renew his hostile demonstrations.
Whether it was because he did not think it quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
safe to trust himself too close to the horse’s heels,
or for the reason that he did not like the looks of
the sixteen-shooters which Eugene and Featherweight
promptly unslung from their backs, we have
no means of knowing. Perhaps it was because the
emigrants had brought their consultation to an end,
and having decided upon their course, came up to
announce what it was.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you are right?” asked an old
white-headed man, addressing himself to Archie.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, as sure as I can be,” was the reply.
“We have taken pains to keep our bearings, and I
am certain that if we have no bad luck, we shall
be in Bolton in less than three days. We shall
travel as nearly south-east as we can to get there,
too.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have concluded to trust ourselves to
you. Bring on the wagons, boys.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never see the Fort,” said Zack, whose
rage was so great that he could scarcely make himself
understood.</p>

<p>None of the emigrants made any reply. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
women and children were assisted into the wagons,
and the drivers climbed to their seats and drove
after Eugene and Featherweight, who rode off over
the prairie. Archie had some difficulty in mounting
his steed, for the animal persisted in keeping his
head toward him, and it was only after repeated
efforts that the boy managed to seize the horn of
the saddle and swung himself upon the horse’s
back. Even after he got there the animal did not
seem disposed to permit him to remain, for he
straightway began to kick and plunge furiously.
But Archie had not lived among the Rancheros of
California for nothing. By thrusting the long
rowels of his Mexican spurs through the hair-girth
with which his saddle was strapped to the horse’s
back, he was able to keep a secure seat in spite of
the furious efforts made to dislodge him; and when
at last his nag was wearied with his fruitless
struggles, he urged him into a lope, and in a few
seconds drew up beside his friends at the head of
the wagon-train.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="small">WHAT ARCHIE KNEW ABOUT MONEY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">The</span> gray-headed man before spoken of, whom
the boys had put down as the father of one of
the two stalwart young men who were driving the
wagons, was riding Archie’s old horse, which Eugene
had offered him, and was talking earnestly with
Fred and his companion. It was plain that the
subject of their conversation was either an exciting
or an alarming one, for the old man’s face was as
white as a sheet, and his voice trembled when he
addressed Archie.</p>

<p>“Do you think those men were wilfully misleading
us, or that they were lost like ourselves?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“They certainly were not lost,” answered Archie.
“Men of their stamp don’t get lost on the prairies.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>“What object could they have had in view in
taking us so far out of our way?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I do not know, unless they had reason
to believe that there is something of value in
your wagons.”</p>

<p>“Did they mean to rob us?” cried the old man,
in great alarm.</p>

<p>“Their actions were suspicious, to say the least,”
returned Archie, who did not care to say anything
that would add to the old man’s terror. “But you
are safe from them now. If they come about your
camp again, all you have to do is to order them
away.”</p>

<p>“I certainly have something of value with me,”
continued the emigrant, after a moment’s pause,
“and I am not afraid to trust you with the secret,
for you look honest. There’s a million dollars and
more in that first wagon.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Archie. “And did they
know it?”</p>

<p>“They did, for I told them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish you hadn’t done it.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>That was what Archie said aloud; but to himself
he added: “You ought to have a guardian
appointed for you, old as you are.”</p>

<p>The emigrant said nothing after this. The
knowledge that he had harbored robbers in his
camp for the last three days made a deep impression
on him, and he gradually fell back beside the
wagons, where he seemed resolved to remain. He
wanted to keep a sharp eye on his treasure.</p>

<p>“That is the most simple thing that a grown
person was ever guilty of,” said Archie, as soon as
the old man was out of hearing. “Why couldn’t
he keep still? I’ll tell you what’s a fact, fellows,”
he added, after thinking a moment, “if there are
any more men like Zack and Sile loose in this
neighborhood, I’d rather be alone on the prairie
than to stay with these wagons.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we shall see them again?” inquired
Eugene.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that men like those will let so
much money slip through their fingers if they can
help it?” asked Archie, in reply.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>“More than a million dollars,” exclaimed Featherweight.
“What shape is it in, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“If I had that amount of money, I’d travel in a
little better style than he does,” said Eugene. “He
and his family are all in rags, and his mules and
oxen look like the breaking up of a hard winter.
He’s an old miser.”</p>

<p>“He may have an object in it,” said Featherweight.
“Perhaps he doesn’t want any one to suspect
that he is worth so much.”</p>

<p>“Then why does he go and tell it?” demanded
Eugene. “I wonder if it is in gold or silver!”</p>

<p>“Neither,” said Archie.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I just guess at it.”</p>

<p>“But you must have something to go by in your
guessing. I wonder how much a million dollars in
gold would weigh!”</p>

<p>“If it was in eagles, it wouldn’t fall very far
short of thirty-five hundred pound, avoirdupois,”
said Archie.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>“How much?” cried both the boys, opening their
eyes wide with amazement.</p>

<p>Archie repeated his statement, adding:</p>

<p>“You know that such articles as gold, silver and
precious stones are weighed by Troy weight. If
you could put a hundred thousand gold eagles (that
would be just a million dollars) on one side of a
jeweller’s scales, it would take a four thousand
pound weight on the other to balance them.”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>A</sup></a></p>

<p>“Well, there’s no such weight in that rickety old
wagon,” said Eugene, as soon as he had recovered
from his surprise. “It wouldn’t hold it up. It
must be in greenbacks.”</p>

<p>“How large an amount in greenbacks do you
suppose you could carry?” asked Archie. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
mean in small bills, ranging from ones up to twenties.”</p>

<p>“O, I could carry all you could pile on me,”
said Fred, confidently, “two or three million,
probably.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and five or six million,” said Eugene.</p>

<p>“That’s much better than I can do,” said Archie,
with a laugh, “and while I was in the Fleet Paymaster’s
office during the war, I had more than one
opportunity to try my hand at it. We used to get
drafts from Washington on the sub-treasury in St.
Louis, calling for two hundred thousand dollars.
When the chief went up to draw the money I
generally went with him, taking with me two large
carpet-bags to bring the greenbacks home in. The
money was put up in square packages of such size
that two of them were all I could get into each
carpet-bag. It was my business, after the money
was drawn, to look out for it until we reached Cairo.
In carrying it from the sub-treasury to the Planter’s
House, where we always stopped&mdash;I forget just how
many blocks I had to walk&mdash;I was always obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
to rest at least once on the way, and to put the carpet-bags
down for a minute or two on the steps of
the hotel before going up to my room.”</p>

<p>“And only two hundred thousand dollars in
them?” cried Fred.</p>

<p>“Are greenbacks as heavy as that?” exclaimed
Eugene.</p>

<p>“They made my arms ache, I assure you,”
replied Archie, “and I was glad when they were
safe in the strong box at Cairo. Now, judging by
that, how much do you think a million in small
bills would weigh?”</p>

<p>“O, I’ll not make a guess,” said Featherweight.
“I don’t want to show how ignorant I am.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose you could lift it?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;no; could I?”</p>

<p>“Hardly; and to prove it to you, I will tell you
a little circumstance. You perhaps remember that
during the war the steamer Ruth was burned, having
on board about four and a half millions of
dollars, intended for the payment of the troops
stationed along the river. She was supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
have been set on fire by some members of the rebel
secret service; but when it got abroad that the
money was all lost, people began to accuse the paymasters
who had charge of it with being in some
way mixed up with its disappearance. Everybody
knows that when a Mississippi river steamer gets
on fire she burns like so much paper; but still there
were those who thought that the money might have
been brought off. Why didn’t the paymasters&mdash;there
were four of them, and that would have been
just about a million apiece&mdash;save it while they were
saving themselves? There were plenty of soldiers
to guard it, and why didn’t some of them catch it
up and swim ashore with it? It could have been
easily done, so people said, and the fact that it was
not done started the story that the money was not
on board the Ruth at all&mdash;the paymasters had
pocketed it, and burned the boat to cover its loss.</p>

<p>“About this time it so happened that our chief
went to St. Louis alone after money; but having
forgotten the draft, he telegraphed to me to bring it
up to him. I left Cairo on Sunday afternoon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
not being able to make connections at Odin, was
obliged to stop over until the next morning. The
only hotel in the town being full, the proprietor
put me into a room with a gentleman in citizen’s
clothes, who had in his possession a cigar box which
he handled as carefully as if it had been a torpedo.
Having so valuable a piece of paper about me, I
was, of course, somewhat particular as to the company
I kept. I was naturally anxious to know
something about my room-mate, and a reference to
the hotel register showed me that he was an army
paymaster. Of course, I felt perfectly safe in his
presence after I found that out. I scraped an
acquaintance with him, and he turned out to be one
of the paymasters who was on board the Ruth when
she was burned. Before we retired he showed me
the contents of his box. It was the charred
remains of a package of greenbacks which he had
recovered from the wreck, and which he was taking
to Washington to prove to the authorities there that
the money had really been destroyed.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>“Did he tell you why it was not saved?” asked
Eugene.</p>

<p>“He did, and the reason was this: The money
was packed away in four iron-bound boxes, each of
which was so large and heavy that it took eight
men to carry it from the forecastle up the stairs to
the boiler deck where the money was kept under
guard. Wouldn’t a paymaster have looked nice
swimming ashore with one of those boxes under his
arm?”</p>

<p>The two boys gazed at Archie a moment in mute
surprise, and then faced about with a common
impulse and looked at the wagon behind them in
which the emigrant said his treasure was stowed
away. Whatever it was, it must have been something
that did not weigh much, for the mules walked
along easily and rapidly, and their traces were
slack more than half of the time. The boys had
learned something. Their curiosity had been
aroused too, and they were impatient for the camping
hour to arrive in order that they might, if
possible, obtain a glimpse of the box containing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
emigrant’s wealth. What could it be? And with
this inquiry arose another. Since the emigrant
had been so very imprudent as to tell Zack and
Silas that he had something with him worth a
million dollars, was not the vicinity of that wagon-train
a dangerous place for them? The boys began
to think so, and to wish most heartily that they
had never seen it.</p>


<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1">A</a> There may be those who will be as surprised to read
this as Fred and Eugene were to hear it. If they doubt
the accuracy of Archie’s statement, and will go to the trouble
to make a calculation, taking as a basis the weight of a
gold eagle, which is about 11 pwts. and 6 grs., and bearing
in mind that a pound Troy contains 5760 grains and a
pound avoirdupois 7000 grains, they will find that he spoke
within bounds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="small">ARCHIE MAKES A TRADE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">The</span> last time we saw the Sportsman’s Club, as
we have already said&mdash;when we speak of the
Club now we include all our friends who left Bellville
in the <i>Stranger</i> for a voyage around the world&mdash;they
were located in their camp a short distance
from Fort Bolton, having just been joined by Dick
Lewis and old Bob Kelly, the famous trappers, who
held so high a place in the estimation and affections
of Frank and his cousin Archie. All our friends
now, from the old sailor down, had a warm place in
their hearts for them, for it was by their assistance
that Walter had been rescued from the most
dangerous situation in which he had ever been
placed.</p>

<p>It was not likely that the Club would ever forget
the thrilling adventures through which they had so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
recently passed. If they desired to bring them
more vividly to mind, all they had to do was to go
up to the Fort and take a look at the outlaws, who
were there confined in irons and under guard, or
ride down the gully to Potter’s rancho, where the
final scenes in the drama had been enacted.</p>

<p>The Club never grew tired of visiting the rancho.
They spent many an hour there, exploring every
nook and corner of the building, and more than one
article of plunder which had there been secreted,
did they find and give into Colonel Gaylord’s possession.
Everything that had fallen to the share of
Dick Lewis and old Bob had been carefully preserved,
and was also given into the charge of the
commandant, to be returned to its lawful owners, if
they should ever be found. Each boy retained a
few things of no particular value, to remind him of
the robber band, and Frank kept the horse Potter
had presented to him. He told the colonel how he
came by him, and the colonel said it was all right.
Frank had borne a prominent part in the exciting
scenes that had transpired during the last few days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and the colonel probably thought it no more than
right that he should be allowed to keep the horse, as
a small reward for his services.</p>

<p>This horse was the occasion of a spirited controversy
and rivalry, which straightway arose between
the cousins, and was similar to that which had
taken place when they first came upon the prairie,
years ago. Frank thought much of his new acquisition,
which was really a magnificent animal, and
boasted of his qualities, while Archie made light
of them, challenged him to a race, and was badly
beaten for his pains. Then Archie borrowed every
fast horse about the Fort that he could hear of, and
ran him against the black, which left them behind,
one and all, so easily that it was really provoking.
Even Dick’s fine nag, the one Frank had stolen
out from under the rifles of the herders, and which
his owner declared could not be beaten by anything
that stood on four feet, was distanced, and Archie,
Eugene and Featherweight&mdash;of course these two
sided with Archie in everything&mdash;laid their heads
together and declared that something must be done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
What that something was that ought to be done
they could not make up their minds, until one day
Eugene, who was strolling about the Fort, examining
everything there with as much interest as though
he had never seen it before, accidentally overheard
a conversation between Frank and Lieutenant
Gaylord which suggested something to him. There
had been a race that morning between the cousins,
Archie being mounted on Dick’s horse, in which
Frank as usual came out ahead, and he and the
lieutenant, who were fast friends, were having a
hearty laugh over it.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine animal of yours, Nelson,” said the
young officer, “but there never was a horse yet so
swift that some other couldn’t beat him. I know
where there are two, and I can put my hand on one
of them almost any day, which can take him down
in a mile race, as easily as falling off a log.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“One of them belongs to a one-eyed Indian who
comes to the Fort occasionally. He is a mouse-colored
animal, spotted all over with white, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
looks odd enough at a distance; but he is pretty
when you get close to him, and is as fleet as an
antelope.”</p>

<p>“And the other?”</p>

<p>“He belongs to father; but he doesn’t do him
much good, seeing that he has not set eyes on him
for three months.”</p>

<p>“Was he stolen?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“No; he escaped and joined a drove of wild
horses.”</p>

<p>“Then there is no danger that Archie will get
hold of him.”</p>

<p>“None whatever.”</p>

<p>“And how about this Indian’s horse? Couldn’t
he buy him?”</p>

<p>“No. There isn’t an officer about the fort who
has not tried to purchase him, but the owner will
not sell him. These Indians know a good horse
when they see him as well as a white man does.
They are like the Arabs. They will sell any of
their old hacks, but their best stock they keep for
their own use.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>This was all Eugene could catch of the conversation,
but it was quite enough to set him to thinking.
He hurried back to the camp, to find Fred and
Archie, and taking them off on one side, told them
what he had heard.</p>

<p>“I only hope that horse will come about while
we are here,” said Archie.</p>

<p>“So do I,” replied Eugene. “We’ll try our best
to buy him. It is no sign that we should fail because
others have done so. We may have something the
Indian wants.”</p>

<p>“Look there!” said Bob, suddenly calling to the
three friends. “Isn’t that a queer colored blanket
that man has spread over his horse?”</p>

<p>The boys looked and saw a horseman riding
toward the fort. A closer examination revealed the
fact that he was an Indian; and a still closer
inspection of the animal he rode satisfied them that
what Bob had supposed to be a blanket, was not a
blanket after all. It looked more like a leopard
skin. Bob was the first to discover his error, or at
least to speak of it.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>“I declare,” said he, as the Indian drew nearer,
“I believe the spots are in the horse!”</p>

<p>“I know they are,” whispered Eugene, excitedly.
“Now if the man on his back is a one-eyed Indian,
he’s the very fellow we’re looking for. Let’s go
and see.”</p>

<p>The boys walked rapidly toward the Fort, but
before they reached it the Indian had dismounted
at the gate, where he was joined by Frank and
Lieutenant Gaylord. The former seemed to be very
much interested in the horse. He gave him a good
looking over, passed his hands over his sleek skin,
felt his legs, examined his mouth, and then put his
hands into his pockets and stood off again and
looked at him. His actions were enough to satisfy
Archie and his two friends that they had not been
mistaken in the horse. They slackened their pace
and loitered along, to give Frank and the lieutenant
time to finish their examination and get out of the
way, and when they saw them go into the Fort they
ran up and accosted the Indian. He had one eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
and consequently, as Eugene declared, must be the
man they wanted to see.</p>

<p>“Hallo, uncle,” said Featherweight. “That’s
an odd-looking beast you’ve got there.”</p>

<p>“Me chief, no uncle,” said the Indian.</p>

<p>“Ah! all right. You Indians put one in mind
of Artemas Ward’s military company, you’re all
officers. I’ve never seen one of you yet who did
not claim to be a chief. Where did you get
him?”</p>

<p>“Injun raise him,” replied the owner of the
horse.</p>

<p>“He isn’t good for much, is he? He looks as
though he were made up of three or four horses of
different colors.”</p>

<p>“He good as three, four, half dozen,” said the
Indian. “Keep good.”</p>

<p>“You don’t care about selling him, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, s’pose Injun sell, what you give?”</p>

<p>“O, I don’t want him,” said Fred. “I’ve got
one that just suits me.”</p>

<p>“I have a horse I’ll trade for him,” said Archie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
“How much boot will you give me? I know he is
good, for I rode him all the way from Salt Lake
City.”</p>

<p>“Where he?” asked the Indian, looking around.</p>

<p>“O, he’s down at the camp.”</p>

<p>“S’pose you let Injun see him.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will.”</p>

<p>Archie walked off, whistling as he went, and
acting altogether very unconcerned; but he was
in reality highly excited. The Indian talked as if
he might possibly be induced to trade, and the
prospect of owning a horse that could beat his
cousin’s, was enough to put Archie in the best of
spirits. He caught his nag, which was feeding near
the camp, saddled and bridled him, and rode back
to the Fort. He found his friends waiting for him
on the other side of the stockade, where they had
taken the Indian and his horse, so that Frank, if he
should happen to come out, should not see what
was going on. They intended to make the trade,
if they could, and surprise him.</p>

<p>“There’s a horse for you, chief,” said Featherweight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
as Archie rode up and dismounted. “If
he isn’t a good one I never saw one.”</p>

<p>A grunt was the only reply the Indian made.
Whether it was intended to express contempt, or
something else, the boys did not know. He gave
Archie’s horse a good looking over, while the owner
and his companions stood near, calm and indifferent
to all outward appearance, but really very anxious,
and impatient to hear his decision.</p>

<p>“Well, speak up,” said Eugene, as the Indian,
having completed his examination, stepped back to
take a general survey of the horse. “Will you
trade?”</p>

<p>“You got blanket?” asked the savage.</p>

<p>“O, we’re not going to give you more boot than
you can carry away&mdash;you may depend on that,”
said Featherweight.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind throwing in a pair of blankets,”
said Archie.</p>

<p>“Good?” asked the Indian.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’ll be good. Not a hole in them.”</p>

<p>“And to make you feel a little better over it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
perhaps we’ll add a pipe or two and some tobacco,”
said Eugene.</p>

<p>“Five pounds?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we’ll say five pounds.”</p>

<p>“You got six-shooter short-gun?”</p>

<p>No, Archie was quite sure he had no revolver
that he could spare. He had but two, and he
might need them before he saw home again. But
Eugene suggested that he might purchase a second-hand
weapon of the sutler, and after some debate
the point was conceded.</p>

<p>The bargaining thus commenced continued for
nearly half an hour, the Indian showing himself as
smart as any Yankee in a trade, sticking to his
points with so much pertinacity that the boys were
obliged to yield to every one of them, and finally
Archie left his companions in high glee and walked
into the Fort. When he came out again, a few
minutes afterward, he carried a pair of blankets
over his arm, an army revolver in his hand, and
his pockets were filled with tobacco, powder, lead,
cartridges, pipes and knives. The Indian critically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
examined every article as it was passed over to him,
and then after shifting his saddle to the back of
Archie’s horse mounted and rode off, leaving Archie
holding fast to his new purchase and looking first
at one and then at the other of his companions, who
were so highly elated that they could scarcely
restrain their glee until the Indian was out of
hearing.</p>

<p>“We did it,” said Featherweight, who was the
first to speak.</p>

<p>“And so easily, too,” added Eugene. “You
got him cheap, Eugene, if he is as good as the
lieutenant says he is. Your old horse cost you
seventy-five dollars in Salt Lake, and the articles
you bought of the sutler, being all second-hand,
could not have cost you much more than twenty
dollars. Ninety-five dollars is little money for a
good horse.”</p>

<p>Archie drew a long breath and looked at his nag
with an expression of great satisfaction on his face,
which, however, quickly changed to a look of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
anxiety as a disagreeable thought intruded itself
upon him.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” said he, “perhaps this isn’t the horse
we want at all. I have my suspicions. That
Indian parted with him almost too willingly.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” exclaimed Eugene. “O no, that can’t
be. The lieutenant said the horse was mouse-colored
and covered all over with white spots, and
that his owner was a one-eyed Indian.”</p>

<p>“But if there should happen to be two mouse-colored
horses about the Fort and two one-eyed
Indians,” said Fred, dolefully, “why then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And another thing,” continued Eugene, when
Featherweight paused, “didn’t we see Frank and
the lieutenant looking at this very horse while we
were on our way from the camp? That meant
something, according to my way of thinking.”</p>

<p>“If I have been cheated,” said Archie, “I shall
never hear the last of it.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t been cheated,” said Eugene.
“Lend me the horse for about five minutes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
you and Fred stay here till I come back. I’ll soon
settle the matter.”</p>

<p>Archie’s saddle and bridle were quickly put upon
the mustang, and then Eugene mounted him and
rode around an angle of the stockade into the
gate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="small">THE NEW HORSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">As</span> Eugene rode through the gate the sound of
laughter, which he knew came from the lieutenant’s
quarters fell upon his ear. Inside the
apartment was gathered a gay party, consisting of
the lieutenant, Frank Nelson and some of the
younger officers of the Fort. The doors and windows
were open, and they could see every thing
that went on outside. The lieutenant was telling
some amusing story, in the midst of which he suddenly
paused, and jumping to his feet hurried to
the door. Eugene saw him, but pretended he did
not, and reining in his horse, began looking all
about the Fort as if he were in search of somebody.
The lieutenant said something in a low tone to those
in the room, and in a second the doors and windows
were filled with heads. That was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
enough to satisfy Eugene, who turned about and
would have gone out again had not the lieutenant
called to him.</p>

<p>“Hallo, there!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Ah! glad to see you,” said Eugene, riding up
in front of the young officer’s quarters. “Hope you
are enjoying your usual good health. You haven’t
seen anything of Uncle Dick about here during the
last hour or two, have you?”</p>

<p>“Whose horse is that?” demanded the lieutenant,
without replying to the question.</p>

<p>“This?” said Eugene, innocently. “O, he’s
one Archie Winters picked up a short time ago.
Do you know anything about him?”</p>

<p>“Archie hasn’t bought him?” exclaimed the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;yes; I believe so.”</p>

<p>“Why, it can’t be possible! What sort of a
looking man was it he bought him of, do you
know?”</p>

<p>“A one-eyed Indian,” exclaimed Eugene, glancing
through the door at Frank, whose face wore so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
comical a look of blank amazement that Eugene
wanted to laugh outright. “Got him cheap, too&mdash;about
ninety-five dollars.”</p>

<p>“It is very strange, and I can’t understand it,”
said the young officer, whose surprise seemed to
increase every moment. “To my certain knowledge,
that Indian has been offered three hundred
dollars for this horse, time and again.”</p>

<p>He came out to examine the animal, in order to
make sure that he was not mistaken in him, and
then went in again and held a whispered consultation
with Frank; while Eugene once more made
inquiries concerning his Uncle Dick, who, he knew
perfectly well, was in camp enjoying his after-dinner
smoke and nap. As he was about to ride away
the lieutenant called to him again.</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell Archie that if he would
like to dispose of that horse I’ll give him a good
trade,” said he.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him, but I don’t think he wants to sell.
He needs a horse, and this one will perhaps suit
him as well as any other.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>“I should like to have him for a curiosity,”
added the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“That’s what Archie wants him for, I believe&mdash;or
something else. If you can’t tell me where to
find Uncle Dick, I guess I’ll go. Good-by.”</p>

<p>Eugene rode away from the lieutenant’s quarters
demurely enough, but as soon as he was safe
through the gate and out of hearing of Frank and
the rest, he threw himself forward on the horn of
his saddle and laughed so heartily that Fred and
Archie, who were waiting for him behind an angle
of the stockade, looked at him in amazement as he
came up. Their faces brightened at once, for they
knew he had good news to communicate.</p>

<p>“It is all right,” said Eugene, as soon as he
could speak. “If you want to see a crest-fallen set
of fellows, just go and call on the lieutenant. He
says he’ll buy this horse if you want to sell him.
He’d like to keep him for a curiosity.”</p>

<p>“O, he would, would he?” said Archie. “I
know a story worth two of that. I don’t want to
sell.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course you don’t. Now let’s go down to
camp, and after Fred and I have saddled our horses,
we’ll go out and have a gallop. I want to see this
fellow move.”</p>

<p>The others readily agreed to this proposition.
The numerous defeats they had sustained in their
efforts to make Frank “take a back seat,” as they
expressed it, had made them timid, and they wanted
to know just what their new horse could do before
they began boasting of his speed. The camp
reached and the horses saddled, the three boys rode
off and finally disappeared behind the swells.</p>

<p>The races that began as soon as they were out
of sight of the camp and Fort continued for half an
hour or more, each boy in turn riding the new
horse; and the rapidity with which he moved over
the ground when put to the top of his speed, and
the ease with which he left the others behind, were
enough to make the three friends dance with delight.
They did not know that there were three
persons who were watching their movements with a
great deal of interest, but such was the fact. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
of them was an Indian, who had thrown himself flat
upon the summit of a neighboring swell, so that
nothing but the top of his head could be seen above
the grass, and the others were two horsemen who
sat in their saddles in plain view of the racers.
They were Frank and the lieutenant.</p>

<p>It was a great mystery to these two friends, not
only how Archie had managed to possess himself
of a horse which nearly every officer stationed at
the Fort had tried in vain to purchase, but also how
he had happened to hear of him. It was their intention
to keep his existence a profound secret. It
was a question in their minds, too, whether or not
Archie knew what a prize he had secured; and in
order to settle their doubts on this point, they
mounted their horses and rode out to watch his
movements.</p>

<p>“I am satisfied now,” said the lieutenant, when
he and Frank had witnessed two of the three races
that came off. “If Archie didn’t know that the
horse was fast when he bought him, he certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
knows it by this time. It is all up with you, my
boy.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind being beaten,” said Frank, “only
I have crowed over Archie a good deal, and he will
pay me back a thousand fold. No one can beat
him at that.”</p>

<p>“There’s no way to avoid it, that I can see,
unless you catch that wild horse of father’s. That
would be a feather in your cap and money in your
pocket. The race will take place to-morrow, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>But, as it happened, the race did not come off
the next day, nor in fact on any day. An unlooked-for
incident which happened that night saved Frank
from defeat.</p>

<p>“Well, Archie,” said Eugene, at the conclusion
of the third race, during which the new steed,
which was plainly growing tired of the sport, took
the bits in his teeth and made a persevering attempt
to run away with Featherweight, who was riding
him, “if you never had a good horse before you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
got one now, and Mr. Nelson will have to take a
back seat, sure.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t want to run him against the black
to-day,” said Fred. “He’s getting tired. We
don’t want to go back to camp either, for there’s
nothing interesting going on there; so how shall we
pass the afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know any better way than to follow up
those antelopes again, if we can find them,” said
Eugene. “Perhaps we may succeed in bagging
one of them.”</p>

<p>This was the way the boys had passed a good
portion of the week that had elapsed since the
occurrence of the events at Potter’s rancho. Archie
knew something about antelope, and the manner of
hunting them practised by the hunters of the prairies,
and he had been initiating his friends into the
mysteries of the sport. We mean by this that he
had showed them how to attract the attention and
excite the curiosity of the timid animals, by moving
above the grass a red handkerchief attached to the
muzzle of a rifle; but he had not yet shown them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
how to shoot one, for the simple reason that the
antelope, having been hunted and shot at by the
officers and soldiers of the fort until their numbers
had been pretty well thinned out, had become so
wild and wary that Archie could never induce them
to come within reach of his Maynard, which would
have been sure death to one of them at six hundred
yards. So in pursuit of the antelope the boys went;
and the fact that during the whole of the afternoon
they saw not the first sign of the game, did not
dampen their ardor or detract from the pleasure of
the brisk gallop they enjoyed. Neither would it in
any way have marred their sport had they known
that there was an eye watching all their movements;
that it followed them in all their windings and
turnings, and that when they rode into camp at
dark, the owner of it was not more than two
hundred yards behind them.</p>

<p>The Club’s camp was permanently located upon
the banks of a small stream which ran through a
thickly-wooded dell about a quarter of a mile from
the Fort. When they first pitched upon that spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
as a suitable camping-ground, they little thought
that that stream was one of the famous trout brooks
of which they had heard so much. It had more
the appearance of the sluggish bayous so common
in Louisiana. Its banks were low and marshy, the
water was muddy and almost too warm to drink,
the bed of the stream was filled with quicksands,
in which a horse and his rider would sink out of
sight, and taken altogether, one would as soon
expect to find alligators and water-moccasins there
as the speckled beauties in which anglers take so
much delight. But the Club having explored the
stream almost to its source, knew that its fountainhead
was located among the hills about two days’
journey from the Fort; that for twenty miles the
brook was one succession of foaming cascades; and
that under every shelving rock along the banks was
a deep and silent pool in which the trout fairly
swarmed. The strings of fish they caught there
were far ahead of anything Frank and Archie had
ever drawn from the brooks about Lawrence, and
two days’ splendid sport made no apparent diminution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
in their numbers. There seemed to be just as
many left, and they were so eager to be taken that
they would snap at a naked hook.</p>

<p>But the Club could not spend all their time
in fishing, however much they enjoyed the sport.
They expected to remain at the Fort not more than
two weeks longer (Dick had warned them that the
mountain passes would soon be blocked with snow,
and that if they intended to return to California
before the winter set in, they had but little time to
spare), and there was still much to be seen. They
scoured the prairie and foot-hills for miles on each
side of the Fort; knocked over sage hens and jack
rabbits by the dozen; chased a young grizzly bear
that had strayed down from the mountains, and
obtained one or two shots at elk and black-tails;
but there were two species of animals that were
occasionally seen about the Fort which they had not
yet been able to find&mdash;buffalo and wild horses.
The buffalo had been driven off the range by the
hunters, who, in order to procure their hides,
slaughtered them at all seasons of the year, and wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
mustangs, Dick said, were not as often met with as in
the years gone by. He had not seen any for a long
time. True there was a small drove of horses
which was now and then seen in the neighborhood
of the Fort, but the animals comprising it were not
mustangs. They were from the States, and it was
supposed that they had either strayed away from
some emigrant train, or been stampeded by the
Indians. Among them was a small bay horse, with
black points and a white star in his forehead, which
had once belonged to Colonel Gaylord. He had
escaped from the herders, joined this half-wild
drove, and having gained his liberty seemed determined
to keep it. He was a valuable animal, and
it was understood that his owner was ready to pay a
handsome reward to any one who would capture
and return him.</p>

<p>It had by this time become pretty well known
that Archie had traded for a new horse during the
day, and the Club were talking about it when he
rode into the camp. As he dismounted in front of
the fire there was a general setting down of plates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
and a simultaneous rush made by all the boys, who
were as eager to examine the new horse as his
owner was to exhibit him. They knew that the
animal had been purchased on purpose to beat
Frank’s horse, and they had a multitude of questions
to ask about him.</p>

<p>“I suppose you two don’t care to see him, do
you?”</p>

<p>This question was addressed by Eugene to Frank
and Dick, who kept their seats by the fire, and
devoted their whole attention to their suppers.</p>

<p>“I have seen him once before to-day,” said
Frank.</p>

<p>“And what opinion have you formed regarding
him?”</p>

<p>“I think he’s a very good-looking old hack.”</p>

<p>“O, do you?” exclaimed Archie. “It is very
kind of you to say so much. But if you will take
a ride with me to-morrow morning after breakfast,
I’ll warrant you’ll think he is something besides an
old hack before you see the last of him.”</p>

<p>Every one present understood that this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
equivalent to a challenge, and Frank promptly
accepted it as such, being resolved to “die game.”</p>

<p>“Now, Dick, let’s hear what you’ve got to say,”
continued Eugene.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t give much for him,” was the
trapper’s answer.</p>

<p>“Not much&mdash;a horse and about twenty dollars
worth of blankets and things.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you gin that much.”</p>

<p>“Why? Isn’t he worth it?”</p>

<p>“I reckon he is.”</p>

<p>“Then why are you sorry?”</p>

<p>“O ’cause.”</p>

<p>“That’s no reason at all,” said Fred. “You’re
sorry the black is going to get beaten, but we can’t
help it. We don’t want to take dust all the time,
and what’s more, we don’t intend to do it.”</p>

<p>Dick made no reply. He only smiled and
glanced at old Bob, who gave him a significant look
in return. Archie saw it, and knew that Dick had
some other reason for wishing the trade had not
been made. What it was he could not imagine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
He thought of a score of things while he was unsaddling
his horse and staking him out with the
rest, but could decide upon nothing. When he
returned to the fire a well-filled plate was placed
before him, and in taking part in the conversation
and listening to the trappers’ anecdotes, he soon
forgot all about his new horse and the race that
was to come off on the morrow.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="small">THE INDIAN TRADES BACK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">The</span> Club were tired that night, as indeed they
were every night, and sought their blankets at
an early hour. Uncle Dick had undisputed possession
of the little Sibley tent that was pitched on
one side of the fire; Frank, Perk, Walter, George
and Bab bunked in the wagon; Archie and his two
friends slept under a brush “lean-to” which they
had erected for their own especial benefit; and the
trappers passed the night wherever they happened
to be sitting or lying when sleep overpowered them.
On this particular night Dick and old Bob sat up
and smoked after all the rest of the party had
retired&mdash;indeed until they had all fallen asleep
except Archie.</p>

<p>The latter thought as much of his new horse as
he had thought of his first pair of skates, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
found in his stocking on a certain Christmas morning
when he was about eight years old. For a
week or two after those skates appeared he never
went to bed without placing them on a chair close
by, so that they would be the first things his eyes
rested on when he awoke in the morning. He
would have been glad to do the same by the horse,
but as he could not, he contented himself with
lying awake and thinking about him; and thus it
happened that he overheard some conversation that
was not intended for his ears, and which was the
means of bringing him a hard fall and a jumping
headache, which he had for an inseparable companion
all the next day. The conversation referred
to took place between the trappers. The camp had
been quiet for an hour, and old Bob, supposing that
everybody was asleep, removed his pipe from his
mouth long enough to say:</p>

<p>“I’m sorry the leetle ’un gin them blankets and
things fur that speckled hoss, ’cause he’s sartin to
be jest that much out of pocket!”</p>

<p>“I know it,” replied Dick.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>“I was kinder in hopes you’d tell him,” continued
Bob.</p>

<p>“I thought of it, but what good would it a done?
The Injun in course sold him the hoss intendin’ to
steal it agin, an’ we’d best let him take it now, an’
without makin’ no fuss about it, an’ without his
hurtin’ the boy.”</p>

<p>“Wal, mebbe so,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“You see,” added Dick, “if he can’t steal him
one time he will another. If he can’t take him
to-night, mebbe he’ll ketch the youngster alone on
the prairy to-morrer or next day, an’ knock him
down an’ make off with the hoss; an’ that would
be sartin to raise a rumpus; ’cause if that Injun’s
head an’ the sights of my rifle should ever come in
line arterwards, the we’pon would go off whether I
said so or not, an’ then thar’d be one Injun less.”</p>

<p>“I know;” said Bob, “an’ mebbe its best as it is.
Let the Injun have his ole hoss, if he wants him.”</p>

<p>Archie listened in amazement to this conversation
and caught every word of it. He knew now
why Dick was sorry that he had purchased the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
horse. He remembered that the trappers had told
him a dozen stories illustrative of the propensity on
the part of the noble red man to drive a hard bargain
in a horse trade, and after disposing of a
valuable animal for all he would bring, to steal him
at the first opportunity. He knew too why the
Indian could not be prevailed upon to sell the horse
to any of the officers of the Fort. They were
familiar with all the tricks to which he and his
kind were addicted, and the horse, once in their
possession, would be so closely guarded that he
could never get a chance to steal him again. But
Archie was a stranger to the prairie and its customs,
and a boy besides, and the savage did not
think he would run any risk in trading with him.</p>

<p>“And he didn’t run any risk in dealing with me,
either,” said Archie, after he had spent a few minutes
in thinking the matter over. “But he will
run some risk if he tries to steal that horse from me,
as sure as he is an Indian. I gave him all the
boot he asked&mdash;it was a fair, square and honest
trade, and he must stand to it.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>Archie threw aside his blankets, drew one of his
revolvers from its holster and made his way quickly
and cautiously toward the place where his horse was
picketed. He held his weapon in readiness to defend
his property, should occasion demand it, but
there was no one there to dispute possession of it
with him&mdash;that is, there was no one in sight. There
was some one, however, crouching close by in the
grass&mdash;some one who saw all he did, and who followed
behind him at a safe distance as he led the
horse away and made him fast to a sapling, which
stood in the outskirts of the camp and close beside
the wagon. Having done this, Archie removed his
blankets, saddle and weapons from the cabin, rearranged
his bed under the wagon, and laid down
almost within reach of his horse, and in such a position
that he could see the smallest object that might
attempt to approach him.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said he, “if that Indian thinks he
is smart enough to steal this horse, I am ready to
undeceive him. He would stand a much better
chance of getting him if he would return those articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
I gave him and tell me he wants to trade back.
I’d rather give up the horse than be obliged to
stand guard over him night and day. But I’ll keep
him long enough to have at least one race with
Frank, no matter what happens.”</p>

<p>So saying, Archie settled himself into a comfortable
position and prepared to go to sleep, intending
to wake in time to defeat the Indian’s nefarious
designs, if he had any. He knew that when savages
intend to make a descent upon a wagon-train,
they come just before daylight, for it is generally
darkest then, the fires have burned low and the
emigrants sleep the soundest. It was about this
time that Archie wanted to wake up; and if he
succeeded in doing so, he would stand guard over
his property until the whole camp was astir.</p>

<p>The excitement occasioned by the conversation
he had overheard between the trappers kept him
awake for a long time, but sleep overpowered him
at last, and then Archie knew nothing for many
an hour. The camp fire, which Dick had mended
once or twice during the night, had almost died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
away, the moon was out of sight behind the hills,
and the thick darkness which the savage likes best
was fast settling down over the woods and surrounding
prairie, when Archie suddenly became conscious
that there was something going on near him. A
faint, rustling sound, as if some one was trying to
pass carefully through the bushes, aroused him.
Just then a burning ember from the log back of the
fire fell off, blazed up as brightly as a candle for a
moment, and then went out, making the camp and
all surrounding objects look darker by contrast.
But Archie, whose eyes were wide open, had seen
something in that instant of time. He had seen
an Indian crouching in a thicket close to the root
of the sapling to which his horse was tied.</p>

<p>Giving a loud yell to arouse the camp, Archie
jumped to his feet, and making a blind dive in the
direction of his horse succeeded in fastening upon
the lasso with which he was tied to the tree. But
it happened that the lasso was no longer fast to the
tree; it was in the hands of the Indian, who, as
active as a cat, sprang upon the horse before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
boy could come within reach of him. Archie
quickly bracing his feet gave the lasso a tremendous
jerk, believing that if the savage held fast to
it, he could pull him to the ground again. No
doubt he would have accomplished his object had he
had any one but an Indian to contend with. The
latter, much too cunning to be caught in any such trap,
allowed the lasso to run freely through his hands,
and Archie went staggering back against the wagon
wheel. Before he could recover himself the Indian
dashed his heels into the sides of the horse, which
sprang away at the top of his speed, and Archie was
thrown with great violence to the ground; while the
rawhide rope, which was still fast to the horse’s
neck, was drawn so rapidly through his hands that
they were burned almost to a blister. It was all
over in much less time than we have taken to tell
it. Before any of the others, who had been awakened
by Archie’s loud yell, could come to his
assistance, the Indian had obtained possession of
the horse and was out of sight in the darkness.
Then the members of the Club began to bestir themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Uncle Dick pulled aside the door of the
tent and looked out; Eugene and Fred, who missed
Archie as soon as their eyes were open, began
groping blindly for their rifles, under the impression
that the camp had been attacked by the Indians
and their friend carried off by them; the boys in
the wagon quickly made their appearance; while
Dick and Bob sat up and stared at one another with
an expression on their faces which said very plainly
that they had been expecting something of the
kind.</p>

<p>“‘Like a snow-flake on the river, one moment
seen, then lost forever,’” murmured Archie, gazing
in the direction his horse had last been seen.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked all the boys, in a
breath.</p>

<p>“His speckled hoss is gone,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s gone,” repeated Archie, holding his
hands under his arms, as if they were very cold
instead of very warm, “and I am a few dollars out
of pocket.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>“Stolen!” cried the Club, beginning to comprehend
the state of affairs.</p>

<p>They stood motionless and speechless for a few
seconds, as people almost always do when they hear
any astounding piece of intelligence, and then each
boy looked at his neighbor to see what he thought
about it. Eugene, who had been bustling about the
camp, in search of a certain piece of his property
which he could not find, was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, that is not so bad as it might be,” said
he. “Can anybody tell me where to look for my
bridle? We expected to have a race any how, you
know, and it might as well come off now as a few
hours later. Let’s follow him and make him give
up the horse.”</p>

<p>“How are we going to do it?” asked Archie,
dolefully.</p>

<p>“Why, are there not enough of us to take it
away from him if he shows fight?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” said Frank, “but there are not
enough of us to catch him. He is safe by this
time, and we’ll never put eyes on that horse again.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>The trappers said Frank was right; that an
attempt to recover the lost steed would only be time
and energy wasted; and this put a stop to the frantic
search for saddles, bridles and weapons, in which
some of the Club were engaged. The pursuit and
capture of a cunning Indian thief would, the boys
thought, be something to talk about in after days,
and they were loth to allow so fine an opportunity
for distinguishing themselves to pass unimproved.
It was hard, too, to give up that fine horse, of which
they had expected such great things; but the
trappers’ word was law, and the Club, with much
grumbling, and many hearty wishes that they might
have the pleasure of meeting that Indian at some
future time, threw down their bridles and gathered
about Archie to hear the story of his encounter with
the thief. When they had questioned him to their
satisfaction, and the palms of his hands had, at
Uncle Dick’s suggestion, been thickly coated with
soap, they went back to their blankets and finally
fell asleep again.</p>

<p>Archie’s slumber was not very refreshing. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
could not banish thoughts of his lost horse, his head
and hands throbbed, and when he managed to catch
a few winks of sleep, he dreamed of wild mustangs
and fights with Indians without number. By daylight
his hands ceased to trouble him; but his head
reminded him of the hard fall he had received, and
he did not feel much like leaving his blanket. It
required something, however, much out of the ordinary
run of events to wholly depress Archie’s buoyant
spirits; and when Dick reported to him that
his old horse had been found grazing with the
others, he told himself that he was in some slight
degree recompensed for the loss he had sustained.
While he was washing his hands and face at the
brook he was joined by Fred and Eugene.</p>

<p>“Say, Archie,” whispered the former, looking
all around to make sure that none of the rest of
the Club were within hearing, “Dick says he saw
those wild horses this morning.”</p>

<p>“Did he?” said Archie, not in the least interested
in the matter, although under almost any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
other circumstances Fred’s enthusiasm would have
affected him at once.</p>

<p>“Yes. Can’t you go out and catch one? We
should like to see the operation, and Dick says you
are first rate with the lasso.”</p>

<p>“The colonel’s horse is among them, you know,”
said Eugene. “If you should happen to catch him
you would make something by it.”</p>

<p>“But I couldn’t do it,” replied Archie. “If it
were possible for anybody to catch him he would
have been returned to his owner long before this
time.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can go out and look at them, can’t
we? We have never seen any wild horses, you
know.”</p>

<p>Yes, Archie thought they might take a look at
them if they could find them; so a very light breakfast
was hastily dispatched, and the three boys
mounted their horses and rode off, telling their
friends who remained in the camp that they were
going out to catch the colonel’s horse, and that they
were not coming back without him.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>Before they had gone a hundred yards from the
camp, Archie began to wish he had not started at
all. He could not help thinking of the fleet, handsome
animal that had carried him the last time he
was in saddle. His old horse&mdash;the one the Indian
left when he stole the other&mdash;was a shaggy, rough-looking
fellow, but he was one of the best the Club
owned. He had been Archie’s almost constant
companion ever since he left Salt Lake City; had
carried him safely during that long, rapid gallop
from the foot of the mountains to Fort Bolton,
which had been undertaken by the Club as soon as
it was found that Walter was missing, and the fact
that he had borne the fatigue of the journey better
than any of the other horses, Frank’s alone excepted,
had raised him considerably in the estimation
of his owner. But with all his good qualities
he had some bad ones, and the most noticeable one,
just now, was his rough, clumsy way of getting over
the ground. Archie had scarcely thought of it
before, but having backed the Indian’s mustang,
which was a remarkably easy riding horse, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
thought of it now, and told himself that it was
very disagreeable.</p>

<p>But one could not long remain in a gloomy
frame of mind while he had the fresh, invigorating
air of the prairie to breathe, and two such jolly
fellows as Fred and Eugene for companions, and
after he had been half an hour in the saddle Archie
began to feel more like himself. Having as yet
discovered no traces of the wild horses the boys
began to give up all hopes of finding them, and
allowing their animals to settle into a slow walk
they rode side-ways, “woman fashion,” to relieve
their cramped limbs, and talked of the sports and
adventures they had thus far seen since leaving
Bellville, and speculated upon those yet to come.
Finally, when the sun began to show himself
above the hills, Fred broke out into a song, in
which the others joined, and the result of which
was rather surprising.</p>


<div class="center">

<div class="i0">“‘The bright, rosy morning peeps over the hills,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>“Listen! listen!” cried Archie, suddenly.</p>

<p>The boys brought their song to an abrupt ending,
and drawing up their horses gazed at one another
with faces full of wonder.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="small">EUGENE’S PLAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">The</span> three friends were at that moment approaching
the summit of a high swell, and the
noise which interrupted their song came from the
other side. It was an indistinct, muffled sound,
and so very much like that made by a heavily
loaded wagon when rapidly driven, that they looked
toward the top of the swell, more than half expecting
to see a runaway team come quickly into view
and dash down among them. But the noise grew
fainter instead of increasing in volume, and after
listening a moment the boys urged their horses forward
and rode rapidly to the top of the swell.
Then they found that the sound was occasioned by
a drove of horses which had heard their voices, and
were taking themselves off with all the speed of
which they were capable. Featherweight uttered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
cry of delight, but quickly followed it up with an
ejaculation of disappointment.</p>

<p>“I was in hopes they were the wild horses,”
said he.</p>

<p>“And so they are,” returned Archie.</p>

<p>“Why, they don’t act as if they were very wild,”
said Eugene. “See how they shake their heads,
and kick up their heels! Many a time have I seen
our own horses playing that way in the pasture.”</p>

<p>“No matter; they are the ones we are looking
for; and that leading horse belongs to the colonel.
I’ve heard him described often enough to know
him.”</p>

<p>At first Archie’s companions could hardly believe
it. Although the horses ran rapidly they did not
act as if they were frightened, but pranced and
curveted as if they were moved by the same spirit
of mischief that sometimes possesses a domestic
horse, when he flourishes his heels and retreats to
the farthest corner of the pasture, as he sees his
owner coming to catch him. But there was the
colonel’s horse! There was no denying his identity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
for the boys all knew him as soon as they saw
him. The wild steeds ran to the top of the nearest
swell, faced about and looked at the horsemen,
snorted once or twice, and then went to grazing as
if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>“There they are,” said Archie, “and now what
are we going to do&mdash;take a good look at them and
go back to camp?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Featherweight. “We’ll give
them a race of a mile or two, just to be able to tell
our friends that we have chased a drove of wild
horses. What do you say, Eugene?”</p>

<p>“Why,” replied the latter, after a little hesitation,
“I say that I have a plan in my head regarding
those horses, if you will help me carry it out.”</p>

<p>“Of course we will,” said Archie. “Anything
for fun. That’s what we came out here for.”</p>

<p>“It will keep us out on the prairie for three or
four days and nights,” continued Eugene.</p>

<p>“Then one of us had better go back to camp
after our blankets,” said Archie. “It is getting
cold, and we’ll freeze without some covering. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
if Dick is anything of a prophet, it will not
be many days before we shall find the ground covered
with snow. We shall need some food, too,
and a supply of ammunition.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure you won’t laugh at me if my plan
fails,” said Eugene.</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll go back to camp after the
things we need, if you and Fred will stay and keep
an eye on the horses.”</p>

<p>This plan being readily agreed to, Eugene turned
and rode off at a gallop, while Fred and Archie
dismounted and prepared to pass the time as pleasantly
as they could until his return. They hobbled
their horses with their lariats, to prevent them from
running off to join the wild drove, turned them loose
to graze, and seated themselves on the ground to
watch the mustangs.</p>

<p>Eugene had partly developed what he considered
to be a grand scheme for the capture of at least one
of the wild horses. He had been thinking of it ever
since he first heard of the existence of the drove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and he had finally hit upon something which seemed
to hold out bright promises of success. He had read
somewhere that wild horses had been captured by
being kept in motion day and night, and allowed no
opportunity to take food, water or rest. Of course
the swiftest and strongest animal would soon wear
out under such treatment, and when exhausted by
long-continued exertion, and weak from protracted
fasting, he could be easily run down and lassoed, and
still he would be in nowise injured. A day or two
of rest and good care would restore him to full
health and vigor. Eugene had heard much of the
speed of the colonel’s horse and the fruitless attempts
that had been made to capture him, and this
plan of his seemed to be just the thing. He
thought it over in all its details while he was on his
way to the camp, and believed that he could see his
way clearly. He provided for every contingency,
and told himself that he knew just what to do in
any emergency that might arise. But after all, he
found, to his great surprise, that there was one very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
important matter that he had forgotten to take into
consideration.</p>

<p>Eugene found the camp deserted by all save
Dick and old Bob. These two were almost always
to be found there. They had worked hard, had
seen much excitement and met with many adventures
during their sojourn at Potter’s rancho,
and were taking a good rest after it. They
told Eugene that Uncle Dick was visiting with
the colonel at the Fort, and that the rest of the
Club had gone up the brook fishing.</p>

<p>“When they come back, whar’ll I tell ’em you’ve
gone?” added Dick, seeing that Eugene was busily
engaged in gathering up various articles that were
lying about the camp. “I want to know wharabouts
to look for you when you’re wanted.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll find us somewhere along the foot
of the mountains between here and the Missouri
river,” replied Eugene. “That’s not very definite,
I admit, but I can’t come any nearer answering
your question. We have found those horses!”</p>

<p>“Wal?” said the trapper.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>“And we’re going to bring one of them back
with us.”</p>

<p>“Sho!” exclaimed Dick. “You haint agoin’ to
racin’ with them critters, be you?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. We know better than that. We
are going to drive them down.”</p>

<p>Dick looked at Bob as if wondering whether or
not he had heard aright, and then arose and approached
Eugene.</p>

<p>“What did you say you was goin’ to do?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you call it,” answered
Eugene, “but we’re going to keep those horses in
motion until they’re tired out, and then we’re going
to catch one of them.”</p>

<p>“Youngster,” said the trapper, lowering his
voice as if he were afraid that some one might overhear
what he was about to say, “that’s the only
way the colonel’s hoss can be ketched.”</p>

<p>“Then we can do it, can’t we?” exclaimed
Eugene, delighted to hear his plan endorsed by so
high an authority.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>“Sartin. Me an’ ole Bob’s jest been talkin’
about it. Now, how are you goin’ to work it?”</p>

<p>“Why, we’re going to take after them and follow
them up until we tire them out, and then Archie
will ride up and lasso one of them.”</p>

<p>Dick looked down at the ground and meditated a
moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon I see through it quite,” said he.
“You don’t say nothing about restin’ your own
horses an’ yourselves.”</p>

<p>“Eh!” exclaimed Eugene.</p>

<p>“While you’re tirin’ out the wild hosses won’t
your own get tired out too, if you don’t give ’em a
chance to eat an’ rest?”</p>

<p>Eugene’s hopes fell instantly. This was the important
part of his plan that he had not thought of.
Of course if the wild steeds were to be “driven
down,” it was necessary that their pursuers should
occasionally be mounted on fresh horses, or else the
chances were that by the time the mustangs were
exhausted, their own nags would be in no better
condition.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you say anything to the leetle ’un about
this?” asked Dick presently.</p>

<p>“Who? Archie? No. I’ve kept it to myself.”</p>

<p>“Then that ’counts fur it. I didn’t think he’d
go in fur sich a thing, ’cause he knows it can’t be
did; an’ so will you arter you think it over.
Howsomever, I’ll tell you what you can do: You
see&mdash;but if you go you’ll have to camp out fur three
or four nights&mdash;mebbe six or seven.”</p>

<p>“We don’t care for that. We’ll be prepared,
you see,” said Eugene, pointing to the bundle he
was making up.</p>

<p>“An’ won’t your uncle care, nuther?”</p>

<p>“No. He knows that we used to camp out in
the swamps of Louisiana for weeks at a time.”</p>

<p>“An’ you won’t be afraid when you hear the
coyotes a yelpin’ an’ a howlin’ around you of nights,
and you all alone on the prairy?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. We’ve heard wolves before we
ever saw the prairie.”</p>

<p>“Wal, go ahead if you’re so sot onto it. The
leetle ’un can take keer of himself an’ you too;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
but if so be you should happen to get into any
difficulty, as you’d be sartin to do if that keerless
Frank was along, mebbe me an’ ole Bob’ll be
around. An’ as fur drivin’ them hosses&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here the trapper proceeded to give Eugene some
very explicit directions as to the manner in which he
ought to proceed in order to make his experiment
successful; but we will not stop to repeat them, as
they will all appear as our story progresses.</p>

<p>Eugene listened attentively, and after satisfying
himself that he fully understood his instructions, he
gathered up his friends’ blankets and his own,
together with a goodly supply of bread and meat,
some ammunition for Archie’s Maynard and his
Henry rifle and Fred’s, a hatchet and a few other
articles he thought they might need, and strapping
them in a bundle behind his saddle, mounted his
horse and rode gayly out of the camp. He laughed
when he thought what a great mistake he had made
in laying out his first plan, and felt more certain
of success than ever. The trapper had assured
him that failure was next to impossible if the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
were rightly managed, and Eugene began to enjoy
in anticipation the reception that would be extended
to him and his companions when they rode into
camp with the captured horse. Of course they
didn’t want any reward for restoring him to his
owner, and wouldn’t accept any. If the colonel
would allow them to keep him a day or two, just
long enough to run a few races and take a little of
the conceit out of Frank, they would be abundantly
satisfied.</p>

<p>A few minutes’ ride brought Eugene to the top
of the swell where he had left his friends, but they
were not there. The wild steeds had moved nearer
to the hills during his absence, and Archie and
Fred had followed in order to keep them in sight.
Eugene set up a loud shout and presently heard a
faint response. After repeating the call, to make
sure of the direction in which his friends had gone,
he rode down the swell and in a quarter of an hour
joined his companions and found them in their
saddles slowly following the mustangs, which were
moving in a body toward the distant mountains.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing Eugene did was to distribute the
ammunition he had brought with him and to divide
his bundle, which was rather too bulky for one
horse to carry. While he was thus engaged his
friends reminded him that he had not yet told them
what his plan was; so Eugene went into details, to
which the boys listened eagerly, and said in conclusion:</p>

<p>“Dick assures me that if we keep the horses
moving, we ought to travel at least twenty-five
miles between daylight and dark, and that will
bring us to the mountains the day after to-morrow.
We must keep them walking all the time, but we
must not push them too closely, for if we frighten
them they will run away from us and we may never
see them again. If we keep them travelling as
nearly north-west as we can, we shall discover, when
we come within sight of the mountains, a tall, isolated
rock, which, at a distance, looks exactly like a
chimney. Close to the foot of this rock is a gully,
which leads to a beautiful valley about twenty
miles back in the mountains. Dick says that is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
horses’ stamping-ground, and if we can make them
go in there we’ve got them sure. This valley is
about ten miles in circumference, and has no outlet
except the gully before spoken of; and all we’ve
got to do is to make our camp right in the mouth
of this gully, so that they can’t get out, and then
relieve one another in the work of driving the
horses down.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall not really begin business until we
reach this valley?” said Featherweight.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Eugene. “While we are on the
prairie the wild horses will have the same chance to
eat and rest that ours will; but when we once get
them cornered we’ll fix them. What do you think
of it, any how?”</p>

<p>The boys were loud in their praises of the scheme,
and Archie, who had often read of such things,
wondered he had not thought of it before.</p>

<p>During the next two days nothing transpired
worthy of note. The boys steadily followed the
wild steeds, which finally seemed to become somewhat
accustomed to their presence. During the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
first few hours they were very restive, and on
several occasions, when the boys in their eagerness
followed them a little too closely, they took to their
heels and left them far behind. They turned out
of the way once or twice for water, but kept the
same general course, and on the afternoon of the
third day brought their pursuers within sight of the
landmark the trapper had described to them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="small">THE WILD MAN OF THE WOODS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Dick Lewis</span> had warned Eugene that constant
vigilance was to be the price of his success,
and among other things had told him that,
before his expedition was ended, he might discover
that horses were the most obstinate and contrary
things in the world. The drove could probably be
driven very easily, he said, until they reached the
entrance to the gully; and then, if they found that
they were expected to enter it, the chances were
that they would take to their heels, leaving their
pursuers nothing to do but to make the best of their
way back to the Fort. Eugene, remembering the
warning, took measures to prevent so abrupt an
ending to their hunt. He sent Archie out on one
flank and Fred on the other, with instructions to
head off the horses, should they attempt to escape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
while he himself followed after them as before.
But it happened that no very serious difficulty was
experienced, and everything would have worked
smoothly but for an unlooked-for incident that
occurred, and which they could not have guarded
against, even had they been expecting it.</p>

<p>The horses had been without water all day, and
knowing probably that there was none to be found
nearer than the valley toward which they were
heading, they kept straight on at a rapid walk,
turning neither to the right nor left, and in an
hour more were fairly between the two high hills
which marked the entrance to the gully. These
hills were two or three miles apart. A few hundred
yards farther on the gully proper began, and was
not more than a quarter of a mile wide. Once in
there, they were safe. Then the work would begin
in earnest. The spring which watered the valley
was located at the other end of the gully, twenty
miles away in the mountains, and Eugene, who was
the acknowledged leader of the expedition, had told
his companions that the drove must not be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
to stop there to drink. The wild steeds had travelled
at least twenty-five miles that day, with no
nourishment except the few mouthfuls of grass they
had been able to snatch as they passed along, and
some of them acted as if they would like to stop
and rest. If the boys camped that night as usual,
the horses would doubtless pass on to the spring,
refresh themselves with a good drink, eat their fill
of the luxuriant grass growing about, take a good
rest, and by the time their pursuers reached the
valley, which would be on the afternoon of the following
day, the wild nags would be ready for a long
and hard test of endurance. In order to prevent
this the council of war, which Eugene called, decided
that no camp should be made that night.
They would follow the drove through the gully,
drive it on past the spring, and while two of their
number made the camp and took rest and refreshment,
the other would keep the horses in motion.</p>

<p>Archie thought their plans had been laid with
considerable skill. He was on the right flank of
the drove, which the boys called the post of honor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
for there was some responsibility connected with it.
If the horses became contrary and declined to enter
the gully, the probabilities were that they would
attempt to run by it instead of turning back, and in
that event Archie was expected, if he could not
head them, to capture one of the drove; for the
boys were resolved that they would not go back to
the Fort without catching something, and in order
to make the agreement more binding, they had
shaken hands on it.</p>

<p>Archie was prepared for anything that might
happen. He had put himself in the lightest possible
running order, by giving his bundle and weapons
to his companions, and discarding his jacket and
hat. He had tied a handkerchief over his head to
keep his hair out of his eyes, and rode along with
his lariat in his hand and his gaze fastened upon the
leader of the drove. In his eagerness to approach
as close to him as he could, he kept his horse in a
fast walk, and in this way gradually drew ahead of
some of the laggards of the drove, who, fearing that
they were about to be cut off from their companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
broke into a gallop. This set the whole drove
in motion. They went ahead at the top of their
speed, holding straight for the gully, and Archie,
believing that he should have no use for his lasso
that day, was about to tie it fast to the horn of his
saddle, when he saw the leading horses suddenly
swerve from their course, and then stand motionless,
gazing at some object before them that had attracted
their attention.</p>

<p>Archie looked, and saw something crouching
behind a tree on one side of the gully. He put his
hand to his side where he usually carried his field-glasses,
but he had given them with the rest of his
accoutrements into the keeping of his friends. Then
he shaded his eyes with his hand and looked again,
and after a few seconds’ close inspection made out
that the object was a human being, and not a wild
animal, as he had at first supposed. And a most
forlorn looking specimen it was too, unless his eyes
greatly deceived him. It wore the most dilapidated
suit of clothes that Archie had ever seen; its feet
looked like two small barrels, being wrapped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
blankets or hides, no doubt, and from under something
on its head, which might once have been
called a hat, the long unkempt hair was sticking in
every direction. Archie did not get a good glimpse
of its face, and indeed he did not think to try.
His mind was fully occupied with the horses. Forgetting
every thing except that the frightened animals
were on the point of taking to their heels, and
thereby causing him and his companions the loss
of three days’ hard work, Archie called to the man,
for such he believed the apparition to be.</p>

<p>“Say, you!” he shouted. “Couldn’t you step
back out of sight a moment, long enough to allow
these horses to pass you?”</p>

<p>The figure complied with a readiness that was
surprising. As if frightened by the sound of his
voice, it disappeared on the instant, and made a
most precipitate retreat up the hillside, if one might
judge by the shower of stones that came rattling
down among the bushes. The noise frightened the
horses worse than ever. The leaders turned back
upon those behind them, and for a few seconds they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
were mixed up in great confusion, some pressing
one way and some the other. Archie believing
that the hunt was virtually over, and that he and
his friends were to have nothing but their trouble
for their pains, determined to make one bold stroke
to save their fortunes. In response to a touch from
the spurs his horse sprang forward, the wild steeds
parting right and left before him, and with a few
rapid bounds carried his rider into the very midst
of the drove.</p>

<p>Fred and Eugene had stopped at the first sign of
commotion among the wild horses, not knowing how
to account for it and utterly at a loss what to do.
Being willing to leave the management of affairs
entirely in Archie’s hands, they sat in their saddles
and watched his motions with the greatest interest.
When they saw him dashing into the drove, and his
lasso flying from his hand, uncoiling itself as it
went, their joy knew no bounds.</p>

<p>“The hunt is over,” shouted Eugene, in great
glee. “Dick says he doesn’t miss his aim once in
a hundred times.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>“Then this throw must be the unlucky one,”
said Fred, in reply, “for he has certainly missed.”</p>

<p>When Fred spoke Archie’s horse was standing
motionless, and his rider was hauling in his lasso
hand over hand. If he had failed in one thing he
was successful in another, for his sudden charge had
assisted the horses to decide a point they were
unable to decide for themselves. It showed them
that the only safe way of retreat was toward the
gully, and into it they went with all the speed
of which they were capable, every one of them
giving a wide berth to the tree behind which had
stood the object that occasioned their alarm. Fred
and Eugene, although greatly disappointed, had
seen a sight they would not have missed for a good
deal. They had seen a lasso thrown at a wild
horse, and that was something to put into the next
letter they wrote to their friend Wilson. When
they came up with Archie they found him bent half
double, holding his horse by the bridle and peeping
up under the bushes which covered the side of the
gully.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t catch him, did you?” exclaimed
Eugene.</p>

<p>“No, but I did my best, and if my lariat had
been a little longer, I’d have had a different story
to tell, for I made as straight a throw for his head
as I ever made in my life. But I am encouraged
after all. I know that my horse has had good
training and can be depended on. When the lasso
left my hand he stopped as if he had been shot.
If I can only get another chance like that the bay
is ours.”</p>

<p>“Has one of them gone up there?” asked Fred,
seeing that Archie was still peering under the
bushes.</p>

<p>“What was it that made such a commotion
among them?” inquired Eugene.</p>

<p>“The horses have all gone on down the gully,
but the thing that frightened them went up here,”
replied Archie.</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“The Wild Man of the Woods.”</p>

<p>“The what?”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I wish you had seen him&mdash;for I don’t
know what else to call him. He stood here behind
this tree, and the sight of him turned the horses
and frightened them so badly that I was afraid they
were going to run away from us.”</p>

<p>“Was it a man?”</p>

<p>“I judge so. He certainly was not an animal,
for he was dressed; but he acted like an animal,
for when I spoke to him and asked him to get back
out of sight, he went up the hill on all-fours like a
streak.”</p>

<p>“There’s something been up there, sure enough,”
said Eugene. “The fresh dirt on those stones
shows that they have but recently been dislodged
from their bed.”</p>

<p>“What could it have been?” asked Fred, greatly
astonished.</p>

<p>“Ask me something hard,” replied Archie. “If
there had been a menagerie along here lately, I
should say that one of the gorillas had stolen a suit
of the keeper’s clothes and decamped. I have heard
of wild men, but I never saw one before, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
no desire to make his acquaintance. Whoever he
is he had better visit some trader pretty soon, or go
to hunting furs, for his clothes will not last him
much longer.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done about it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Eugene. “We’re hunting
wild horses, and I suggest that we leave the wild
men to take care of themselves.”</p>

<p>“That’s my idea,” said Archie, springing into
his saddle; “so let’s jog along and keep the drove
moving. The sun says it is pretty nearly supper
time; so I think I’ll take a bite. But, fellows, I
should really like to know what that thing was.”</p>

<p>The others said they would like to know too.
There was much speculation indulged in, and
Archie was required to describe the object and its
actions again and again; and after each description
his companions shook their heads, as if to say that
the matter was too deep for them, and applied
themselves with renewed energy to the bread and
meat and flasks of cold tea which they drew from
the pockets of their shooting-jackets. They could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
not explain it after half an hour’s debate, and they
finally came to the conclusion that they did not
know anything about it and never would. After
that nothing was said on the subject, although they
did not cease to think about it, and each boy smiled
at his neighbor when he saw him looking toward
the top of the cliffs which hung over the gully, for
he knew that he was looking to see if there were
any signs of the wild man.</p>

<p>By the time their supper was over (they had
eaten it as they rode along), they again came up
with the wild horses, which, having recovered from
their fright, were moving steadily on down the
gully, stopping only to take occasional bites at the
grass which grew in little bunches at the foot of the
cliffs. It was almost dark now, and the boys, as
they twisted about in their hard saddles, trying to
find a comfortable position for their aching limbs,
thought of the twenty long miles yet before them, and
wished for a roaring fire and a soft, warm blanket.
And these twenty miles were to be ridden during
the night, through a gorge with which they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
entirely unacquainted. There might be a thousand
perils and obstacles in their way. Some savage
beast, like Old Davy, might have an ambush in
there somewhere, or their path might lead along
the edge of some deep long chasm, where a single
slip on the part of their horses would send them to
destruction. Archie was somewhat hardened to
such things, but his companions were not, and when
it is known that Eugene was the one who planned
and suggested this night ride, it will be seen that
he was resolved to accomplish something.</p>

<p>In less than twenty minutes after the sun went
down a deep gloom began to settle over the gorge,
and in twenty minutes more it was so dark in there
that the boys could not discern the nearest objects.
The wild horses were close before them, following
a well-beaten path in Indian file, but the boys could
not see them. They were obliged to trust entirely
to the animals they rode, and these, in turn, trusted
to the leader of the drove. The boys beguiled the
weary hours with song and story, awaking a thousand
echoes in the gorge and no doubt startling more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
than one wild beast which was going his nightly
rounds. But, what was very surprising, the wild
horses, after the first few minutes, seemed to pay
no attention to their voices. Only once were they
frightened, and that was when a violent rustling in
a thicket of bushes at the foot of the cliff, drew a
couple of shots from Eugene’s rifle. Then they
galloped on in advance, but were again overtaken
at the end of half an hour, and their pursuers kept
close company with them until daylight&mdash;so close,
in fact, that Eugene’s nag received one or two
admonitory kicks from the last horse in the line.</p>

<p>The night passed at length, to the boys’ great
relief, and the morning sun began to gild the summits
of the surrounding mountains. His rays
gradually found their way into the gorge which just
here was as straight as if it had been cut out for a
railroad, and about a mile in advance of them the
boys saw the valley into which it opened. The
horses saw it too, and gradually quickened their
pace to a rapid walk, then to a trot, and finally to a
gallop; but their pursuers kept close behind, Archie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
leading the way. Their object now was to drive
them beyond the spring, which Dick told them they
would find at the end of the gorge; and Archie,
thinking that he might possibly have another opportunity
to try his lasso on the bay, handed his bundle
and weapons to his friends, and pressed close upon
the rear of the drove. Furthermore, he anticipated
the very thing that happened&mdash;a momentary confusion
about the spring, which Eugene, from the
information the trapper had given him, was able to
describe so accurately that Archie knew just where
to look to find it, and a chance to use his lasso,
which, if quickly improved, would save them a day
or two of hard work. Archie noticed that the
horses were not nearly as wild as they had appeared
to be when they first found them. They had grown
more and more accustomed to the presence of their
pursuers as the days went by, and now, having
passed the night in their immediate company, they
seemed to pay no more attention to them than they
did to the members of the drove. Archie could not
decide whether this indifference was the result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
fatigue or increasing confidence; but whatever it
was, he was ready to take advantage of it. In
order to see just how far he could go, he turned
his horse out on one side, and to his great gratification
and the no small surprise of his companions,
galloped along side by side with the rear horses in
the drove, which, if they felt any displeasure at this
familiarity, showed it only by laying back their
ears and biting at his horse.</p>

<p>Archie gradually urged his nag forward, and
before the valley was reached he had passed more
than half the drove, and was riding within fifty
yards of the bay which looked over his shoulder at
him occasionally, but did not increase his speed or
show any alarm. He was heading straight for the
spring. Archie began to tremble with excitement.
One after the other the members of the drove were
passed, and at length only three horses were running
between Archie and the leader. Just then the
bay turned quickly out of the path, and in a
moment more was standing knee-deep in the spring
which bubbled out from under the cliff.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>And now happened the event for which Archie
was looking and for which he was prepared. The
other horses crowded in upon the bay&mdash;his own
would have followed had he not restrained him&mdash;and
in less time than it takes to tell it the spring
was full of rearing, kicking, biting animals. But
they were not permitted to remain there long. The
leader began to assert his authority. Raising his
head with an angry snort, he sent his heels right
and left to such good purpose that he quickly
cleared a space about him. The instant that his
head was elevated was enough for Archie. The
lariat left his hand, true to its aim this time, and
settling down over the bay’s neck was quickly
drawn tight. Finding himself fast, the horse
started to run, but the other end of the lasso was
securely fastened to Archie’s saddle, and his own
horse bracing himself to meet the shock, the captured
steed was thrown flat on his side. The others
snorted with terror and took to their heels in short
order.</p>

<p>When Fred and Eugene arrived upon the ground
they saw something exciting.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="small">THE EMIGRANT TRAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">“Hurrah</span> for you, Archie!” shouted Eugene,
as he and Fred came galloping up. “You’ve
made sure work this time, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I told you that if I got another fair chance at
him he was mine,” replied Archie. “You had a
suspicion that I was shooting with a long bow, last
night, when I told you that I had seen a horse help
his master catch cattle, didn’t you, Fred?”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Featherweight, quickly. “I
only thought it something wonderful.”</p>

<p>“I told you I had seen a horse hold a steer down
while his owner butchered him, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>“Well, now you will see my horse hold this
fellow down while I put a bit in his mouth. Look
out, there,” he added, as the boys, having dismounted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
ran up to watch his movements; “don’t
come too near his heels, for he can out-kick a mule.
Keep a good hold of your own horses too, or they’ll
go off to join the drove.”</p>

<p>Archie’s nag, as his owner afterward declared,
had shown himself to be a “perfect trump.” He
seemed to know what the boy intended to do as
well as the boy knew it himself. When the lariat
settled down over the bay’s head and the latter was
about to run off, he planted his fore-feet firmly on
the ground to stop him, and the bay was thrown on
his side, as we have described. Archie’s horse,
without waiting for the word from his rider, quickly
backed up until the lariat was drawn tight, and thus
the bay was held as securely as if he had been tied
to the ground.</p>

<p>Archie, finding that his horse could be depended
on, quickly dismounted, slipped the bridle off his
head, and when Fred and Eugene came up he was
kneeling on the bay’s neck, trying to force the bits
into his mouth.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to ride him now, are you?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
exclaimed Fred, amazed at Archie’s apparent recklessness.</p>

<p>“Certainly I am,” was the reply. “He’s got to
be backed some time, and it might as well be now as
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to get a saddle on him?
You can’t put the girth around him while he is
lying down.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any saddle!”</p>

<p>“Why, he’ll throw you and break your neck!”</p>

<p>“If he does it shan’t cost him anything,”
answered Archie, as he buckled the throat-latch
about the bay’s neck. “Now, Fred, slack up on
that lariat, please, and give us room according to
our size and importance. We shall need plenty of
space to spread ourselves in!”</p>

<p>Fred, in compliance with the request, unfastened
the rawhide rope from Archie’s saddle, and then he
and Eugene, still holding fast to their horses and
leading Archie’s, retreated quickly to the foot of
the cliffs. As soon as Archie saw that they were
out of the way, he removed his weight from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
bay’s neck, and in an instant the captured horse
was on his feet. How Archie managed to get upon
his back as he was rising was a great mystery to the
two boys who were looking on&mdash;it was done so
quickly. But he was there, and he had secured a
firm seat, too.</p>

<p>The bay was no sooner on his feet than he began
to make the most desperate attempts to shake off
his rider, but all to no purpose. When he reared,
Archie pounded him between the ears with his
clenched hand; and when he kicked, he used his
spurs with such hearty good-will that the horse was
glad to desist. During all the terrific struggle
Archie was as cool as a cucumber and was never
once moved from his seat. Failing in his efforts to
throw his rider, the bay tried to run, and this Archie
not only permitted, but encouraged. There were
two well-beaten paths at this point, one running to
the right and the other to the left around the valley,
and when the bay showed a desire to try his speed
his rider turned him into one of these paths and
touched him gently with the lariat, which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
managed to gather up, and now held in a coil in
his right hand. The horse responded on the instant,
and with a few rapid bounds carried Archie
out of sight behind the trees. The boys stood
listening to the sound of his hoofs for a moment,
and then turned and looked at each other.</p>

<p>“That is something I never saw done before,”
said Eugene, at length.</p>

<p>“And if anybody had told me that it could be
done, I wouldn’t have believed him,” added Fred.
“He will probably go on around the valley, and as
that is a good ten-mile ride, we shall have plenty
of time to make the camp and get something to eat
before he returns.”</p>

<p>The boys watered the horses at the little brook
that ran from the spring, staked out their own animals
(having no lasso with which to picket Archie’s
horse they hobbled him with a halter so that he
could not stray far away) and then went to work to
prepare breakfast. From one of the bundles Fred
brought to light a small sheet-iron camp-kettle, a
coffee-pot and a hatchet. While he was undoing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
another, which contained the small supply of bacon
and hard-tack they had remaining, Eugene picked
up the hatchet, and in a few minutes had split up
dry wood enough to start a roaring fire. The camp-kettle
was filled with water from the spring, several
slices of bacon placed around the fire on spits to
roast, and then the two boys threw themselves on
their blankets to take a few minutes’ rest after their
twenty-four hours in the saddle, and to await
Archie’s return.</p>

<p>He came much sooner than they expected, and
they saw at a glance that that ten-mile gallop had
taken considerable of the wild spirit out of the bay.
He looked as if he had been driven through a stream
of water; his breast was flecked with foam, and,
although he still kept his ears laid back close to
his head and showed a good deal of the white of his
eye, he did not kick and plunge as he had done at
starting, and seemed quite willing to stop when his
rider gave him the word.</p>

<p>“Well?” said both the boys at once.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of meaning in that little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
word, and Archie rightly interpreted it. Fred and
Eugene were anxious to know if their new horse
was swift enough to beat the black.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Archie, drawing his
shirt-sleeve across his forehead; “I am not yet prepared
to say. The horse was tired when he got here,
and as the path around the valley is rocky and full
of logs and brush, he didn’t have a chance to show
himself. But he moves as if he were set on springs
and clears a good stretch of country at a jump, and
there is no telling what he may do after he has had
a good rest. Want to try him, either of you?”</p>

<p>“Well, n&mdash;no,” replied Fred, with so comical an
expression that Archie and Eugene laughed outright.
“I believe I’ve ridden far enough for one
day.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll walk him up and down till he gets
cooled off a little,” said Archie. “After that we’ll
tie him to a tree and blanket him. In the meantime,
if you don’t know what else to do, you might
cook some breakfast.”</p>

<p>“We’ve cooked one breakfast and eaten it,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
said Eugene. “We were too hungry to wait for
you.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to send somebody out on a foraging
expedition pretty soon,” said Fred, holding up
all that was left of the bacon. “To-morrow will see
the last of our provisions, unless we put ourselves
on short rations.”</p>

<p>Fred set about his cooking operations again,
while Eugene reclined on his blanket and watched
Archie as he rode the bay slowly back and forth.
Having once been thoroughly broken to saddle, the
animal was still “bridle-wise,” but, although he
understood every command of his rider, he did not
like to yield obedience. He preferred freedom to
slavery and needed constant watching, for he was
ready to take advantage of the smallest chance
that was given him for escape. He was a very
handsome, stylish animal, and it was no wonder
that Colonel Gaylord did not like to give him up.
When the bacon and coffee were ready, Archie
hitched his horse in a thicket of evergreens, where
he was effectually protected from the cold wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
that was blowing, threw a blanket over him and
went to breakfast.</p>

<p>The boys spent one day and night in their camp
in the valley, during which the bay received the
best of care and fully recovered from his fatigue,
although he did not appear to become reconciled to
captivity. He was a vicious brute, and so quick
with his heels that it was a matter of some difficulty
to handle him, and Archie was the only one who
cared to attempt it. The wild horses seemed to
miss him. They frequently came about the camp
and called to him, and at such times he struggled
so desperately to escape that the boys were alarmed
lest he should injure himself.</p>

<p>Early on the morning following their arrival in
the valley, they packed their bundles and took to
their saddles for the return journey, Eugene leading
Archie’s old horse, and Archie himself riding
the bay. They now had a good view of the gorge,
and it was so full of obstructions&mdash;tangled thickets,
fallen trees and boulders that had tumbled from the
cliffs above&mdash;and the path was so narrow and winding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
that it was a mystery to them how the horses
could have found their way through there in the
dark. They stopped once for a short rest and
lunch, and about three o’clock in the afternoon
arrived within sight of the prairie. They thought
of the wild man, but saw no signs of him.</p>

<p>The way was now clear, and being impatient to
reach the Fort and exhibit their prize, they put
their horses into a lope, and by the time the sun
began to dip behind the mountains they had made
fifteen miles farther on their journey. They
followed a course a few miles to the eastward of
the route they had first travelled, in order to find
water. They knew just where to look for it, for
the trapper had been very explicit in his instructions,
and Eugene had communicated them to his
companions while they were yet fresh in his memory,
so that there might be no chance for any mistakes.
The willows, which pointed out the position of the
stream, came in sight at last, and then the boys
halted and held a consultation. A thin cloud of
smoke slowly rising above the tops of the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
showed them that their camping-ground was already
occupied.</p>

<p>“Ask me something hard,” said Archie, when
his companions, after looking at the smoke through
their field-glasses, turned to him as if to inquire
what he thought about it. “I am sure I don’t know
who they are.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Fred. “I don’t
like the idea of going into a stranger’s camp, for I
have not forgotten Frank’s experience with Black
Bill and his party.”</p>

<p>“But Dick assured me that we had nothing to
fear from any one we might meet,” said Eugene.
“He told me, too, that if we got into any difficulty
he and old Bob would be around.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Dick and Bob are there now,” said
Archie.</p>

<p>“That’s so. We can go down and see, and if
they are strangers we need not intrude upon them.
We can go a mile or two farther up the stream.”</p>

<p>The boys rode down the swell, and in a few
minutes reached the willows that lined both banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
of the stream. No sooner had they entered them
than a chorus of angry yelps and growls arose in
advance, and three or four gaunt, savage-looking
hounds came toward them with open mouths.</p>

<p>“Begone, you brutes!” shouted a voice. “Begone,
I say! Come on, strangers, whoever you be.
They won’t pester you.”</p>

<p>The boys kept on, and when they reached the
other side of the willows, came in sight of the camp.
Two covered wagons were drawn up, one on each
side of the fire, and a span of small, shaggy mules
and a yoke of very poor oxen were grazing close
by on the prairie. About the fire were gathered a
party of men, women and children, half a score in
number, all but two of whom the boys at once put
down as emigrants. Three of these emigrants
were men&mdash;one an old gray-headed patriarch, and
the others sturdy young fellows, one of whom must
have been some relation to the old man, if there
was any faith to be put in the resemblance they
bore to each other.</p>

<p>The two who were not emigrants reminded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
boys of that brace of worthies who had ridden into
their camp on the night Walter was spirited away&mdash;Parks
and Reed&mdash;who were now safe in irons in the
Fort. The dress and accoutrements of these men
proclaimed them to be hunters, but their faces told
a different story. They did not seem at all pleased
to see the boys, but the old man welcomed him
cordially.</p>

<p>“How do, strangers?” said he. “Alight and
hitch.”</p>

<p>“We’re obliged to you,” said Archie, “but we
have no wish to intrude. We thought, when we
saw the smoke of your fire, that perhaps we should
find some of our friends here. We’ll make our
camp a little farther up the stream.”</p>

<p>“No intrusion at all,” said the old man. “You
are almost the only white folks we’ve seen for weeks
till we fell in with our friends here&mdash;&mdash;” nodding
his head toward the two hunters&mdash;“and we’d like to
talk to you.”</p>

<p>Archie hesitated. If the old man wanted him
and his companions to camp with him, it was plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
that the hunters did not, and he was well enough
acquainted with men of their class to know that it
was sometimes a dangerous proceeding to act in opposition
to their wishes. But then these men did
not belong to the train. Archie judged by what
the old man said that he and his company had
fallen in with them accidentally during their journey
across the prairie, and if that was the case, they
had nothing to say.</p>

<p>“Better get down,” urged the emigrant. “We’ve
got grub enough to feed you. We’re on our way
to Fort Bolton; where might you be a travellin’
to?”</p>

<p>“We’re bound for the same place.”</p>

<p>“Then camp with us to-night and to-morrow we’ll
travel in company.”</p>

<p>The promise of a good supper was a very tempting
one to the hungry boys, whose commissary would
have been exhausted long ago if they had given
their appetites full swing, and they knew that if
they accepted the emigrant’s invitation their wants
would be abundantly supplied. There was a coffee-pot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
on the coals, something that looked like biscuits
in a pan beside the fire, and from one of the trees
hung a joint of fresh meat, from which had been cut
a sufficient number of steaks to fill a large frying-pan.
The fact that the tin plates and cups that
were scattered around were not as clean as some
they had seen, and that the emigrant’s wife went
about her domestic duties with a pipe in her mouth,
did not take the sharp edge off their appetites, as it
might have done a few months before. So they
decided to remain. The old man took their bundles,
accompanied them when they went out to picket
their horses, asked them more questions than he
would give them time to answer, and finally went
back to camp to make sure that his wife had obeyed
orders and added more steaks to those already in
the pan.</p>

<p>Fred and Eugene, having picketed their own
horses, went to assist Archie, the bay having suddenly
taken it into his head that he would not allow
himself to be staked out. The boys had a lively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
battle with him, and while it was going on, one of
the hunters came out.</p>

<p>“Look a yer! who be you an’ what brought you
yer?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Archie, who had quite as much on his hands as
he could attend to, was not in just the right mood to
answer such questions, especially when propounded,
as this one was, with all the insolence the man could
throw into his tones. He paid no attention to it
until the man said, pointing his finger at him:</p>

<p>“You heard me, I reckon! What’s your name,
an’ what brought you yer?”</p>

<p>“There, he’s safe enough,” said Fred, when he
had driven down the iron picket-pin with the
hatchet.</p>

<p>“We’ll not trust to that alone,” said Archie.
“We’ll hobble him, too. Now, my friend, in reply
to your question I have to say that I left all my
cards at Fr’isco; but when I return there, as I
expect to do in the course of a month or so, I will
send you one, if you will be kind enough to give me
your address.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>The man stared, and then looked down at the
ground in a brown study. He could not make head
or tail of what Archie said; but when Eugene
spoke, he began to have a vague idea that the boys
were making game of him.</p>

<p>“We’ll send it by special train, too,” said Eugene,
who was highly indignant over the man’s insulting
manner.</p>

<p>“I don’t want no sass,” said the latter. “I
axed you a fair question.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t ask it in a fair way,” said
Archie. “Now, then, stand clear of his heels and
I will let him go,” he added, as Eugene buckled
the halter-strap around the bay’s leg below his knee.
“I think we shall find him here when we want
him.”</p>

<p>The horse was doubly secured now. He was
fastened by a lariat to an iron pin, which was driven
as deeply into the ground as repeated blows from the
hatchet could send it, and his head was tied down
to his feet, so that even if he succeeded in pulling
the pin out he could not run away. The boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
had found that these precautions were absolutely
necessary. They had been so long about this work
that the fresh steaks had had plenty of time to
cook, and when they went back to camp the host
told them that supper was ready, and backed up his
welcome announcement by grasping the frying-pan
by its long handle and passing it to each of his
guests in succession, who helped themselves by
using their hunting-knives in lieu of forks. The
host, not being so particular, fished his share out
with his fingers. The emigrant’s wife passed them
each a biscuit with a hand which looked as though
it had never seen water; a tin cup, with which one
of the youngsters had been amusing himself, was
filled with coffee and handed over with the remark:
“I reckon you three haint afeared of one another;”
and everything being thus satisfactorily arranged
and everybody provided for, the host found a seat
and applied himself to the task of learning a full
history of everything our heroes had done since
they were born. After asking a few questions he
suddenly paused, having thought of something.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>“I declare, I’m losin’ all my manners since I left
the settlements,” said he. “I’m Reuben Holmes,
gentle<i>men</i>, all the way from Pike, Missouri. That
chap there,” he added, pointing to one of the young
men, “he’s Reuben Holmes, junior. He’s my son.
Know him, strangers.”</p>

<p>The boys, with great difficulty controlling their
desire to laugh, bowed to Reuben Holmes, junior,
who did not know enough to acknowledge it in any
way, and the old man went on.</p>

<p>“This ’yer’s my old woman; that big gal is my
darter, and them’s my young children. That chap
is Simon Cool, my hired help. He’s going out to
the mines to run a quartz-mill for me. Them two,”
waving a biscuit toward the two hunters, “are
Zack and Sile. I don’t know their other names,
but they’re friends of our’n. They met us on the
prairie, and finding that we were a trifle out of our
reckoning, they took us in tow and are going to
show us the way to where we want to go. We’re
bound for the mines, and I am going to set up a
quartz-mill there.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>Having thus, as he imagined, placed our heroes
quite at their ease, the old man took a bite out of
his biscuit, first dipping it into the frying-pan, and
went on with his questioning. The boys good-naturedly
replied, paying no heed to the winks,
nods and grunts of disbelief which the two hunters
constantly exchanged with Simon Cool, and finally
the emigrant came down to their recent exploits.</p>

<p>“Where you been lately and what a doing?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“We have just come from the mountains,” was
the reply of Archie, who acted as spokesman.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Zack.</p>

<p>“What were you doing there?”</p>

<p>“Hunting wild horses.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear tell of the like of that,
Zack?” asked Silas.</p>

<p>“I never did,” was the answer. “They’re nice
lookin’ chaps to go a huntin’ wild hosses, haint they
now?”</p>

<p>“An’ the mountains is a likely place to find ’em,
too,” added Silas.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that frisky critter of your’n out there a wild
hoss?” asked the old man.</p>

<p>“He is.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do think in my soul! And you did
ketch him, didn’t you? You say you’re going to
Bolton to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How far is it from here?”</p>

<p>“About three days’ journey, the way you will
travel. We, on horseback, could accomplish it in
less time.”</p>

<p>“Which way is it from here?”</p>

<p>“Off there.”</p>

<p>“Why how does that come?” said the emigrant,
with some surprise. “We’ve been travelling <i>that</i>
way for the last two days,” pointing in just the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Then you have lost your course, or else somebody
has been misleading you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t listen to ’em, old man,” said Zack.
“Tain’t noways likely that me an’ Sile could get
lost.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>“We don’t suppose you could,” said Eugene,
who had been made so angry by the hunters’ sly
winks and nods that he could scarcely restrain himself.
“You know where the Fort is as well as
we do.”</p>

<p>“I reckon we do, an’ better,” said Zack.</p>

<p>Simon Cool, for some reason or other, had been
making persevering, but unavailable, efforts to turn
the conversation into another channel, and Archie,
seeing that Eugene was treading on dangerous
ground, joined in with Simon, and finally succeeded
in getting the old man started on the subject of
mining, on which he could talk like a book. Archie
listened until he had finished his supper, and then
went out to look at his horse. He glanced over his
shoulder as he went, and saw that Simon and the
two hunters were sitting with their heads close
together, as if engaged in consultation.</p>

<p>“There’s something afoot,” thought Archie,
“and I have half a mind to saddle up and clear
out. Here comes Eugene. I’ll see what he thinks
about it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="small">AN ENEMY IN CAMP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">“I heard</span> Dick talking about Pikes the other
day,” said Eugene, who had followed Archie in
order to lend his assistance in case the bay had succeeded
in freeing himself from his halter or lariat.
“Did he refer to such people as our friends here?”</p>

<p>“He did,” answered Archie. “As I understand
it, these Pikes are one of the results of our late war.
A good many of the people in the border states
were completely broken up, their houses being
burned, their crops destroyed and their stock killed
or driven off. It takes time and patience to accumulate
property by farming, and it is hard for a
man to begin over again where he began twenty or
forty years ago. There are not many who have the
courage to do it. These people had heard wonderful
stories of the mines and the sudden fortunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
sometimes made there, and believing that since they
had to dig in the ground for a living, it would be
easier to dig gold and silver than potatoes, they
emigrated by regiments. But where one family
made a permanent settlement in California, a dozen
turned back. But still some of them were not satisfied,
and after staying a year or two in their old
homes, they would bundle up again and go back to
California; and from roaming about so much, they
fell into the habit of leading a wandering, gipsy life.
They are not satisfied with a permanent settlement
anywhere. How the name they bear came to be
applied to them I don’t know, unless it was because
the first of them came from Pike county, Missouri.
This man is a genuine Pike. There is no telling
how many times he has wandered back and forth
over these prairies, but he hasn’t learned much during
his wanderings. I have crossed the prairie
only once, and I know that he is a hundred miles
north of where he belongs.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, hasn’t it occurred to you&mdash;” said
Eugene, looking over his shoulder to make sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
there was no one listening; “by the way, what do
you think of them, any how?”</p>

<p>“I think there is one crazy man in that party,
and two, and perhaps three, villains.”</p>

<p>Eugene reached out his hand and gave Archie an
approving slap on the back, as if to say that he had
given utterance to his own ideas on that point.</p>

<p>“The old man talks sensibly enough about some
things,” said he, “but he is wild on the subject of
money, and has an eye that you don’t see belonging
to a person whose head is perfectly level. Now
hasn’t it struck you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That those two hunters are leading him out of
his way for some purpose of their own?” added
Archie, when Eugene paused. “It has, and I believe
it.”</p>

<p>“But what is their object?”</p>

<p>“You tell. There’s nothing in those wagons
worth stealing, I am sure. Hold on; here comes
one of them.”</p>

<p>Simon Cool was approaching. When he came up
he stated his business without ceremony.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>“Look a yer, strangers,” said he, turning his
head on one side and squirting at Archie, “I want
to know what brought you yer.”</p>

<p>“We have already told you,” answered Archie.
“We expected to find some of our friends here.”</p>

<p>“Wal, seem’ you didn’t find ’em, hadn’t you better
toddle on?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. What do you think about it?”</p>

<p>“I reckon as how you had. Zack and Sile don’t
like the idea of your hangin’ around. They say
you’re here for no good.”</p>

<p>“They’re judging us by themselves; but we’ll
go. We’ve no desire to stay where we are not
wanted. Let’s get our bundles, Eugene. We can
saddle our horses out here without taking them to
the camp.”</p>

<p>“Where you going?” demanded the Pike, as the
boys entered the camp, and after giving Fred a nod
which he understood, began gathering up their
property. “Going further?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we thought we would ride on,” replied
Archie. “We can make a mile or two before dark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
and that will take us just that much nearer the
Fort.”</p>

<p>“I hate to have you go, ’cause we might travel
in company in the morning. If you happen around
this way agin, drop in,” said the Pike, repeating
the stereotyped invitation he had often extended to
his neighbors at home.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Fred. “We are indebted to
you and your good lady for your hospitality, and
hope we shall have a chance to reciprocate.”</p>

<p>“Which?” exclaimed the Pike.</p>

<p>“We thank you for the good supper you have
given us,” said Archie.</p>

<p>“No occasion, strangers; no occasion. Call
often. We always leave the latch-string hanging
out, and keep a bite for anybody that’s hungry.”</p>

<p>The boys bade the hospitable Pike good-by,
shouldered their bundles and saddles and left the
camp. An hour afterward they were safely settled
in a camp of their own about three miles further up
the stream. Of course they had plenty to talk about
during the evening, the family they had just left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
and the misfortunes that would most likely befall
them, if they trusted themselves to the guidance of
the two hunters, forming the principal topics of the
conversation. At eleven o’clock the horses were
brought in and tied in the edge of the willows, and
Archie and Eugene wrapped themselves in their
blankets and went to sleep, while Fred sat up to keep
an eye on the bay, and see that Zack and Silas did
not steal a march on them during the night.</p>

<p>Morning came at length, and after the boys had
drank the last of their coffee&mdash;they had scarcely
enough of the article left to make the hot water
taste like coffee&mdash;and eaten their last piece of
cracker, they made up their bundles and prepared
to resume their journey. It was high time, they
told one another, that something was done in the
way of hunting. They had seen no game when
they passed over the ground a few days before, and
unless some stray antelope or buffalo put itself in
their way, they would be obliged to go supperless
to bed.</p>

<p>The bay behaved so badly on this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
morning that Archie found it impossible to bridle
him, so he made a bridle out of his lasso, passing
the bight over the horse’s head behind his ears,
through his mouth, tying it firmly under his lower
jaw, and leading the ends over his neck and around
the horn of his saddle to serve as reins. Their
preparations being completed they mounted and set
off at a gallop, and the first living objects they saw
when they reached the top of the nearest swell were
the emigrant and his family, who were following a
course lying at right angles with their own.</p>

<p>“Good-morning to you,” cried the old man, who
was marching beside one of the wagons. “Off for
the Fort now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the boys.</p>

<p>“Heading the wrong way, haint you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; we’re heading directly toward it.”</p>

<p>“I say,” exclaimed the emigrant suddenly,
“you’re&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>When he had said this, the two hunters and
Simon began to remonstrate with him. The boys
could not catch their words, but they distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
heard the old man say: “Do you want me to let
them youngsters go off and lose themselves? It
is my bounded duty to set ’em right.”</p>

<p>“I say,” shouted the old man again, “you’ll
never see Bolton if you go that way. You’re
going wrong. Zack and Sile say we’ll be there to-night?”</p>

<p>“Well, Zack and Sile know better than that.
You are the one who is going wrong. We know
what we are talking about, when we assure you
that you are heading as straight from the Fort as
you can go!”</p>

<p>“Whoa!” shouted the Pike, bringing both his
teams to a stand still. “This thing must be settled
now. Come here, boys.”</p>

<p>The three friends moved toward the wagon, but
Archie’s horse declining to approach very near,
pretending to be much afraid of the white canvas
covers, his rider was obliged to dismount and lead
him.</p>

<p>“Now if the Fort is off there, as you say it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
what is the reason that Zack and Sile are leading
us the other way?” demanded the Pike.</p>

<p>“They have reasons of their own, with which we
are not acquainted,” answered Archie. “But
they are going to lose you, and they know it.”</p>

<p>Silas made an angry rejoinder, and this was the
beginning of the conversation which we have already
recorded. We have related all that passed
during the interview, and told how the Pike, suddenly
becoming impressed by Archie’s statements,
abruptly abandoned the guides he had so long
followed, and placed himself and family under the
directions of the boys. We have also told of the
astounding revelation he afterward made in regard
to the treasure which one of his vehicles contained,
the manner in which it was received by the three
friends, and the discussion on the weight of money
that followed, when the old man left them and drew
back beside his wagon. We are now ready to take
up our story where we left off.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>“I know now why Zack and Silas were so
anxious to be rid of us,” said Archie. “They
have designs on that money, or whatever it is, and
wanted a clear field for their operations.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you think Simon Cool is somehow
mixed up with them?” asked Featherweight. “He
seemed to be on pretty good terms with them.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> thought so,” said Eugene; “but it seems to
me that if he were in league with them, he would
have gone off with them, instead of staying with the
train.”</p>

<p>“Unless he can serve his purpose and theirs
better by remaining,” said Archie, significantly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that.”</p>

<p>“Well, their plans, if they had any, are knocked
higher than a kite,” said Fred, “and all we have
to do is to keep our eyes open. I, for one, am
glad things turned out as they have, for now we
are sure of something to eat without the trouble of
hunting for it. But, fellows, I’d like to know
what’s in that wagon. Wouldn’t it be a good plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
to question the Pike, as he questioned us last
night?”</p>

<p>During that forenoon the boys were left entirely
to themselves. The emigrant remained close beside
his wagon, and once when the boys looked at him
they found that he had put on his powder-horn, and
bullet-pouch, and that he carried his long rifle on
his shoulder. He kept looking back, too, as if he
feared the hunters might follow the train; but they
were not once seen during the day.</p>

<p>When the wagons halted at noon the Pike had
but little to say to the boys, and that little related
entirely to the conversation that had taken place
that morning&mdash;the location of the Fort, the distance
they must travel before reaching it, and the probable
object that Zack and Silas had in view in trying
to mislead him. He had not yet recovered from
his fright. During the halt he visited the wagon
every few minutes, pulled up the cover and looked
under it to satisfy himself that his valuables were
safe; but he always took care to fasten the cover
down again, so that the boys, although they passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the wagon a dozen times, on some pretext or
other, could not obtain a glimpse of the interior.
When they stopped for the night his vigilance
seemed to increase. After supper he made the
circuit of the camp several times, with his rifle in his
hand, and having satisfied himself that there were
no enemies near, he spread his blanket under the
wagon and went to sleep.</p>

<p>The boys brought their horses in at an early
hour and also sought their blankets. They had
been almost constantly in the saddle during the last
five days, and began to feel the effects of their
long journey. It had been their custom, while they
were alone on the prairie, to set a watch every
night, but now there seemed to be no need of it.
The only thing they feared was that the bay might
find means to escape; but he seemed to be pretty
well contented just now, and he was as secure as
two rawhide ropes could make him. If a stranger
approached the camp, he would be the first to hear
him. And then, there were the dogs! All the
emigrants seemed to put unbounded faith in them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
and if the Pike was willing to trust himself and
his property to their watchfulness, the boys thought
they would run no risk in doing the same. They
agreed among themselves, however, that each one
should sleep with both ears open, and be ready to
jump up the instant he heard any unusual sounds.</p>

<p>All the emigrants were locked in slumber long
before the boys laid down, at least they appeared
to be; but there was one who was wide awake, and
waiting with a little impatience for them to stop
talking and go to sleep. It was the teamster,
Simon Cool. He waited half an hour, and then
slowly and cautiously raised his head and looked
about him. He glanced sharply at each one of the
prostrate forms, and quietly threw off his blanket.
Having arranged it so that a casual glance at it
would lead one to suppose that it still covered a
human figure, he pulled off his heavy boots and
slipped away barefooted in the darkness.</p>

<p>He was gone a long time, and when he returned
and entered the camp, he did it with so much caution
that no one heard him. He did not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
attract the attention of the bay. The dogs looked
at him, but they had known him so long that he
had nothing to fear from them. He made his way
on his hands and knees to the place where the boys
lay, side by side, and quickly, but without the least
noise, removed their rifles and the belts containing
their revolvers, which they had placed at the head
of their beds. This done, he looked toward young
Reuben Holmes, but it was only to see if he was
still asleep; for Simon knew that he had nothing
about him more dangerous than a rusty pocket-knife,
and that was not worth securing. The only
weapon belonging to the Holmes family was the
heavy, old-fashioned rifle which the old man had
taken to bed with him. This Simon secured as
easily as he had secured the rest, and taking them
all in his arms carried them out of the camp and
laid them on the ground, placing Archie’s Maynard
and a brace of the revolvers by themselves. He
had disarmed everybody in the camp in less than
two minutes’ time, and they all slept on unconscious
of it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="small">THE PIKE’S TREASURE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Having</span> performed his work of disarming the
camp, in a manner perfectly satisfactory to
himself, Simon Cool crawled back to his bed, drew
on his boots and crept under his blanket again.
Scarcely was he fairly settled when two figures
arose from the ground, about two hundred yards
from the camp, where they had been lying watching
all his movements, and ran forward to the place
where he had deposited the weapons. They threw
down their own rifles, quickly buckled a brace of
revolvers about their waists and took possession
of the sixteen-shooters belonging to Fred and Eugene.
Their own rifles and the emigrant’s they hid
away in the willows, and then boldly approached
the camp. The sound of their footsteps aroused the
horse and dogs, and these in turn aroused the slumbering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
men and boys, who started up to see Zack
and Silas standing before the fire with the stolen
weapons in their hands. There was not one among
them who displayed half as much terror and astonishment
at this unwelcome sight as did Simon Cool.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet now an’ do as you’re told, an’ thar
shan’t a har of your heads be hurted,” said Zack.
“But if anybody goes to raisin’ a rumpus he’ll
allers be sorry fur it, ’cause he won’t live as long as
it’d take a hoss to jerk his tail twice.”</p>

<p>For a few seconds no one moved or spoke. They
had all been awakened out of a sound sleep, and it
required a little time and effort for them to gather
their wits about them. The boys did not fully understand
the words that had been addressed to them,
but the simple presence of the two hunters was all
that was needed to explain matters to them.</p>

<p>The Pike was utterly bewildered at first, but
gradually he began to comprehend the situation;
and when he had fully grasped it, his terror knew
no bounds. Jumping from his blanket before either
of the hunters could prevent him, he spread out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
arms before the wagon which contained his treasure,
and broke out into wild lamentations and
defiance.</p>

<p>“I know what you’re here for,” he cried, “but
you shan’t have it. You <i>can’t</i> have it, for it’s robbery,
and that’s something the law don’t allow.
I’ll have you both in jail if you touch it. I’ve
spent years on it and worked hard for it, and you
shan’t have it. I’ll fight till I drop; so I will!”</p>

<p>The old man continued in this strain to give vent
to his feelings of excitement and alarm, but the boys
did not hear what else he said, for his wife, who
had been looking on from the wagon in which she
and the children slept, now joined in with her shrill
voice, and a terrific uproar arose. Threats and
the sight of the cocked rifles pointed full at their
heads, at first had no effect on them. Their treasure
was uppermost in their mind, and while that
was in danger, they cared not for any peril that
menaced themselves. After repeated efforts Zack
succeeded in making himself heard and understood.</p>

<p>“We haint agoin’ to harm none on you if we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
help it,” said he; “but if you don’t shut up, we’ll
tie yer hand and foot; and if that don’t do you no
good, we’ll leave you yer to the wolves.”</p>

<p>This threat restored silence. The Pike’s wife
drew her head back under cover of the wagon, and
the old man wrung his hands and moaned to himself.
In their heartfelt sympathy for him, the boys, for
the time, forgot that they were prisoners themselves.</p>

<p>“Now, if you’ve come to yer senses, we’ll be
movin’,” said Zack. “You two,” nodding to Reuben
and Simon, “hitch up the oxen an’ mules, an’
you, Sile, saddle a horse for me an’ you an’ turn the
rest loose!”</p>

<p>These orders showed that there was a journey
before them, and so the boys, at Archie’s suggestion,
began making up their bundles, keeping their eyes
on Silas all the while, to see which of their horses he
was going to saddle. His first thought evidently
was to take the bay; but the horse turned his heels
toward him, laid back his ears and looked so savage,
that Silas changed his mind, and making a wide
circuit around him to get at his head, he drew his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
knife across the lariats with which he was confined,
and set him at liberty. With a joyful neigh the bay
kicked up his heels and galloped off, the ends of the
lariats streaming in the air behind him. The boys
saw it all, but did not speak until they had made up
their bundles and thrown them into one of the
wagons. Like the man who went twenty miles after
a load of sand, and when he reached home, found
that his wagon was as empty as when he started, the
sand having all leaked out through the cracks, they
felt that their knowledge of the English language
would not enable them to do the subject justice, so
they kept still for a while and thought about it.</p>

<p>“There are five days’ work gone to the bow-wows,”
sighed Archie, at length.</p>

<p>“And Frank Nelson, with his black, is still ahead
of the hounds,” murmured Featherweight.</p>

<p>“I would be willing to remain a prisoner six
months, if the bay had only given Silas one good
kick before he left,” said Eugene, savagely. “What
shall we say when we get back to the Fort&mdash;if we
ever do?”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll say that we caught the horse,” said Archie,
with an attempt to appear cheerful, “but that circumstances
over which we had no control prevented
us from keeping him.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed Eugene. “It is just too
provoking for anything.”</p>

<p>“But it can’t be helped,” said Fred, “and we
might as well laugh as cry over it.”</p>

<p>“Throw us a couple of saddles yer,” said Silas,
who at this moment came up, leading Archie’s horse
and Eugene’s.</p>

<p>“What have you done with my nag?” asked
Fred.</p>

<p>“Turned him loose, I reckon,” was the encouraging
reply. “I turned two loose.”</p>

<p>“Then I might as well put my saddle away in
the bushes,” said Fred, “so that I shall know
where to find it if I ever have occasion to use it
again.”</p>

<p>When the preparations for their journey were all
completed, Reuben and Simon, in obedience to
orders, climbed to their seats in the wagons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
drove after Zack, who rode over the prairie; the
boys and the Pike fell in behind on foot, and Silas
brought up the rear, riding Archie’s horse and carrying
one of the Henry rifles across the horn of his
saddle.</p>

<p>“I declare this beats anything I ever heard of,”
said Eugene, whose wrath had not yet had time to
cool; “six able-bodied fellows captured and marched
off by one-third of their number!”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t so very bad after all, when you
come to think of it,” returned Fred. “I have
heard of three car-loads of passengers being robbed
by four men.”</p>

<p>“These hunters must have followed us all day
yesterday,” continued Eugene, “and of course they
are after the Pike’s money; but I don’t see how
they could have come into our camp and taken possession
of our weapons without awakening some
of us.”</p>

<p>“Ask them how they did it,” suggested Archie.
“They know.”</p>

<p>Acting on the hint, Eugene turned to Silas, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
was riding close behind them, and propounded the
question to him; but that worthy only shook his
head and grinned, and that was all they could get
out of him. Eugene persisted until his two companions
expected to see the hunter become angry;
but he did not. He was in a very good humor, and
no doubt the prospect of soon handling a million
dollars was what made him so. The old man was
depressed in the same degree that Silas was elated.
The first burst of grief being over, he had nothing
to say, but his whole frame quivered and his face
was convulsed with agony.</p>

<p>The boys were not at all alarmed at their situation&mdash;they
were only angry and sorry; angry because
the horse for which they had worked so hard
had been taken from them, and sorry for the Pike,
who was about to be deprived of his hard-earned
wealth. It was true that Eugene, as soon as his
feelings of resentment had had time to wear away, began
to be somewhat anxious in regard to that which
was in store for them, but Archie quieted his fears
by telling him just what was going to happen; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
everything turned out as he said it would, except in
one particular. They would be taken to some
secluded place in the mountains, he said, so that
they would be out of sight of anybody that might
happen to pass on the prairie; the wagons would be
robbed of whatever articles of value they might
contain, and they would then be at liberty to
resume their journey. Their arrival at the Fort
would not be delayed more than three or four days,
at the very furthest.</p>

<p>“No plottin’ agin the Dutch thar!” exclaimed
Silas, noticing that the boys’ heads were pretty
close together, and that they were talking in low
tones. “If you’ve got anything to say, speak it
out, so’t we can all hear it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll ask you a question,” said
Archie. “What are you going to do with us?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, if you behave yourselves,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Then why do you compel us to go with you so
far out of our way? You’ve got all we have that
is worth stealing.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>“But you know too much. You might go back
to the Fort an’ make trouble for us,” said Silas.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said Archie, in a low tone, “and
we may do it yet.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got nobody to thank but yourselves,”
continued Silas. “Why didn’t you cl’ar out, like
we told you to, an’ go about your business? If
you’d a done it you’d a saved yourselves this
trouble.”</p>

<p>The long hours of the night dragged away wearily
enough. Zack pushed ahead at a rapid walk, and
the boys being more accustomed to their saddles
than travelling on foot, soon became very tired.
Dark as it was they managed to keep their bearings,
and they knew that Zack was holding straight for
the mountains. There was no halt ordered until
they reached the foot-hills, and that was just as the
day began to dawn. The wagons were driven into
the willows out of sight, and the emigrant’s wife,
who had not once left her wagon, was instructed to
“crawl out and dish up some grub!” an order
which she obeyed with a very bad grace. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the meal but little was said by either captors or
prisoners, and as soon as it was over the boys took
their bundles from the wagon, spread out their
blankets, and fell fast asleep almost as soon as they
touched them. When they awoke the sun was setting,
the emigrant’s wife was preparing supper, and
Reuben and Simon, acting under the directions of
Silas, who kept guard over them with his rifle, were
hitching up the mules and yoking the oxen preparatory
to another start, which was made as soon as the
supper was disposed of.</p>

<p>This night’s journey was longer and harder than
the preceding one, for it was begun at an earlier
hour. The boys were not allowed to ride in the
wagons, for Silas said they were slippery fellows&mdash;he
knew it by the glint in their eyes&mdash;and he
wanted them where he could watch them all the
time.</p>

<p>Zack held along the base of the mountains, and
at daylight our heroes found themselves travelling
over ground that was familiar to them. The gully
through which they had passed a few days before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
and which led to the valley where the wild horse was
captured, was close before them. Being almost ready
to drop with fatigue they protested that it was quite
impossible for them to go any farther, but Zack did
not listen, for he was not yet ready to order a halt.
He followed the gully as far as the rocks and fallen
trees would allow him to go with the wagons,
then turned into another and finally into a third,
which was so much worse than any of the rest that,
before they had gone a quarter of a mile, one of the
wagons, having been shaken nearly to pieces by being
hauled over boulders and logs, gave out entirely and
came down with a crash.</p>

<p>“Thar’, now, I reckon we’ll stop,” said Zack; and
this was welcome news to the boys, who pulled their
bundles out of the wagon and threw themselves upon
them, completely tired out. But they quickly
straightened up again and began to take some interest
in what was going on, when they found that the
trappers themselves did not intend to make a camp
there. The two men held a short consultation, and
some words which came to the boys’ ears told them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
that the object of the undertaking was now about to
be realized. The emigrant’s wealth was to be
brought to light.</p>

<p>“This is as good a place as any,” said Silas.
“They can’t mend the wagon an’ find their way out
afore to-morrow, an’ by that time we’ll be miles
away.”</p>

<p>The expression on the emigrant’s face showed
that he too had overheard the words, and that he
understood them, but he made no other sign. He
had scarcely spoken for the last twenty-four hours.
He seemed to be bewildered, stunned by his misfortunes.
When Zack and Silas dismounted and
raised the cover of the wagon which contained his
treasure, he looked on in a stupid, benumbed sort of
way, which almost led the boys to believe that he
had taken leave of his senses.</p>

<p>“This must be it,” said Silas, after taking a
survey of the interior of the wagon. “It’s the
only thing yer that looks like a chist!”</p>

<p>The hunter thrust his hands into the wagon, and
when he drew them out again they were grasping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
the handles of a small black trunk, which, like all
the rest of the Pike’s furniture that the boys had
seen, looked as though it might have made many
a journey between Missouri and California, for it
was in a very dilapidated condition. The leather
was worn off in a dozen places and the lid was
loosely held on by one hinge and a piece of rope.</p>

<p>“There goes the labor of a lifetime, and I am a
ruined man,” sighed the Pike, resting his elbows
on his knees and gazing at the box as if fascinated.</p>

<p>“They’ve got hold of it, then,” whispered
Archie, who would willingly have given everything
he possessed to have been able to defend the old
man’s property. “How I wish Dick and old Bob
would come in here now. It isn’t money, though.
It is too light.”</p>

<p>“Thousand dollar greenbacks, may be,” said
Fred, in the same low whisper.</p>

<p>“Or bonds, perhaps,” suggested Eugene.</p>

<p>The hunter’s face expressed great astonishment.
He had expected to find the trunk very heavy, but
he lifted it with all ease with one hand. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
overheard the old man’s words, however, and dashed
at the box like a hound on a fresh trail. So great
was his eagerness and impatience to see the inside
of it, that his hands trembled with such violence
that he could not undo the rope. The longer he
tried the more the knot was jammed; and at last
Zack, fully as impatient as his companion, whipped
out his knife, cut the rope, and with one savage
kick sent the lid flying into the air.</p>

<p>The old man groaned and the boys arose to their
feet to obtain a view of the contents of the box.
They could see no money or packages that might
contain money or other valuables&mdash;nothing but a
small brass frame, the inside of which was filled
with wheels and weights made of the same material,
the whole contrivance somewhat resembling the
works of a clock. Silas stared at it a moment and
then jerked it out of the box and threw it on the
ground behind him, expecting no doubt to find
something hidden under it. But this was all. The
hunter then picked up the trunk, shook it, looked
at it all over, thumped it with his knuckles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
then to make sure that it contained no secret compartments,
dashed it in pieces on the ground and
carefully examined each separate fragment. He
was astounded, and so were the boys, who were looking
on with almost breathless interest.</p>

<p>“Whar is it, old man?” panted Silas, scarcely
able to speak, so great was his excitement.</p>

<p>“Why there it is,” said the Pike, gazing ruefully
at his machine, and then at the ruins of his trunk.
“There’s uncounted millions in it!”</p>

<p>“In that?” shouted Silas. “Whar’s the
money?”</p>

<p>“I have no money. That is yet to be earned.”</p>

<p>A long silence followed this reply. The expression
of rage and disappointment on the hunters’
faces was curious to behold.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="small">SNOWED UP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">“I</span> never in my life was so overjoyed to see men
disappointed,” whispered Eugene. “They’ve
had all their trouble for nothing, and I am glad of
it.”</p>

<p>“Be careful,” replied Archie, earnestly. “Don’t
say that again; for if they should chance to overhear
you I don’t know what they would do. They are
perfectly desperate.”</p>

<p>For two or three minutes the hunters stood like
statues looking at one another, and then they made
the cliffs echo with horrible yells and imprecations.
Their rage was perfectly ungovernable and the boys
trembled in fear of the result. Zack’s first move
was to demolish the machine, which he did most
completely with one kick of his foot, sending the
wheels and weights in every direction. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
and Silas jumped into the wagons, which they proceeded
to overhaul most thoroughly. Not the
smallest article escaped close examination. Clothes
were ripped up, in the hope of finding something
hidden away in the seams; the one bed the family
possessed was torn open and its contents scattered
far and wide; skillets and frying-pans were sounded,
as if the hunters expected to find some hidden compartments
in them, and then smashed into atoms on
the boulders; and in five minutes’ time the emigrant
had not a single whole article of furniture, bedding
or clothing left. The boys looked on with great
indignation, but were powerless to stop the wanton
destruction. It would have been dangerous even to
remonstrate with the enraged men.</p>

<p>“I say, fellows, just cast your eyes toward Simon,”
whispered Archie, suddenly.</p>

<p>The boys looked, and told themselves that some
things which they had not been able to understand,
were perfectly clear to them now. They had discovered
another guilty man, and one whom nobody
had suspected. If Simon Cool was not as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
interested in finding the treasure as the hunters
were, and if he was not as keenly disappointed to
learn that the contents of the black trunk which the
old man had watched so closely, were an invention
of some kind, instead of a million dollars in gold,
his face belied him.</p>

<p>“Do you know now how we were disarmed that
night?” whispered Archie.</p>

<p>“I believe I do,” replied Fred, “and I shouldn’t
wonder if the scamp was about to get himself into
trouble. I certainly hope so. See how Zack and
Silas scowl at him.”</p>

<p>“If I thought you had fooled us a purpose, Simon,
you’d never fool nobody else, I bet you,” said Zack,
in savage tones.</p>

<p>Simon glanced around with a frightened look,
and saw that everybody had heard what the hunter
said to him. Even the old man raised his head and
listened.</p>

<p>“O, you needn’t try to play off on us that way,”
exclaimed Silas. “You’re as deep in the mud as
we are, every bit. You told us that the ole man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
was wuth a million dollars&mdash;an’ he’s the lad who
stole your we’pons from you while you was asleep,”
he added, nodding to our heroes.</p>

<p>“We thought so,” answered Archie.</p>

<p>“Now if thar’s any yaller boys about here, whar
are they?” demanded Zack.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Simon, who saw that he
could not conceal his real character any longer.
“Everything the ole man’s got was in that black
chist. He told me so, an’ said he wouldn’t take a
silver-mine fur it!”</p>

<p>The hunters looked keenly at Simon, and the
expression on his face, rather than the words he
had uttered, satisfied them that he had told the
truth. The feelings of rage and disappointment
which showed themselves in his countenance were
genuine, and could not have been assumed.</p>

<p>“Wal, you an’ the ole man atween you have got
us into a scrape, an’ we hain’t made nothing by it,”
said Zack, at length. “Thar hain’t none of us
made nothing, I reckon,” he added, glancing at the
ruins of the Pike’s furniture. “Now we want all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
of you to stay here till we’re safe out of the way;
an’ to make sure of your stayin’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here Zack raised his rifle and shot one of the
oxen dead in the yoke. Silas shot the other and
then the mules, and thus the emigrant and his
family were left almost as helpless as they would
have been had they been cast away on some desert
island in the middle of the ocean. The hunters
then led their horses to the place where the boys
were standing, and Zack began untying his blankets,
which were fastened in a bundle behind his saddle.
Addressing himself to Archie, he said:</p>

<p>“A fair exchange hain’t no robbery, they say, so
give me them blue ones o’ yourn, an’ I’ll give you
mine. We hain’t goin’ away without something, I
bet you.”</p>

<p>“I think you’ve got something already,” said
Fred. “You’ve got a rifle worth forty-five dollars,
and a horse and saddle that cost almost a hundred
more.”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t get the million dollars, so hand
out them blankets!”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>“An’ I’ll trade with <i>you</i>,” said Silas, nodding to
Fred.</p>

<p>Without another word of remonstrance the boys
rolled up their clean, warm blankets, just as good
now as the day they were purchased in San Francisco,
in spite of the service they had seen, and
handed them to the hunters, who gave them their
own tattered and dirty army blankets in return.
Although the boys could hardly bring themselves to
touch them they did not refuse to take them, for
they knew they would need them. The weather
was cold, and it had been growing colder ever since
they left the prairie. The wind came up the gorge
in fitful gusts, whistling mournfully through the
branches of the evergreens above their heads, and
now and then the air was filled with flakes of snow.
The storm which Dick Lewis had so confidently
predicted had fairly set in, and some covering, besides
the clothing they wore, was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>“Now whar’s the cartridges fur these we’pons?”
said Silas.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>“We haven’t any,” replied Fred and Eugene;
and to prove it they turned their pockets inside
out.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you bring more’n one load with you?”</p>

<p>“One magazine full, you mean,” said Eugene.
“Isn’t that enough? There were sixteen shots in
one and fourteen in the other when we gave them
to you&mdash;or rather when you took them. When
those loads are gone you’ll have to skirmish around
and find more.”</p>

<p>“An’ whar’s the ammunition fur these?” said
Simon Cool, who now came up with a brace of
revolvers buckled about his waist and carrying
Archie’s Maynard in his hands.</p>

<p>“Ah! you’ve got my rifle, have you?” said
Archie. “I wondered what had become of it.
There’s a load in it, and much good may it do you.
I haven’t any more to give you.”</p>

<p>It was perhaps fortunate for our heroes that the
men did not ask any more questions about the ammunition.
Fred and Eugene had thrown away
their cartridges during the first night’s march, declaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
that if the hunters were going to steal their
rifles, they needn’t think they would get powder
and bullets for nothing. Archie, however, who had
not seen anything of his Maynard, and believed
that it had been hidden somewhere near the camp,
kept his cartridges, but when Zack and Silas overhauled
the wagons, his rifle was thrown out with
the rest of the things, and then Archie pulled out
his ammunition and dropped it behind the boulder
on which he was sitting.</p>

<p>“You can’t get anything to shoot in that rifle in
this country,” said Archie, “and since it is of no
use to you, hadn’t you better give it back to me?
I have owned it a long time and don’t like to part
with it.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll keep it,” said Simon, in reply.
“I reckon me an’ my pardners can use it.”</p>

<p>“Who’s your pardners?” demanded Zack,
quickly. “Not me an’ Sile, I can tell you, fur
you hain’t goin’ a step with us&mdash;not one step.”</p>

<p>This showed that there had been some sort of an
agreement between Simon and the hunters. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
doubt when the million dollars were secured, they
were to share it equally and travel in company.</p>

<p>“If you’ll fool us once you’ll do it agin; so we
don’t want nothing more to do with you,” said Silas.
“You can go your trail an’ we’ll go our’n.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know whar to go,” said Simon, who
was utterly confounded; “an’ I can’t stay here.”</p>

<p>“No, you can’t stay here,” said the old man.
“When you were tramping about the country begging
your living, I took you in and cared for you,
and now you have turned against me! You can’t
stay here.”</p>

<p>“This yer’s a big country, an’ thar’s plenty of
room in it fur all of us,” said Zack.</p>

<p>With this piece of information the hunters mounted
their horses and rode down the gully out of sight.
Simon Cool stood motionless and silent for a moment,
gazing fixedly at the ground, and then shouldering
Archie’s Maynard, he moved slowly away in the
same direction and also disappeared. Bad as their
situation was, the boys told themselves that Simon’s
was infinitely worse. They knew where to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
find friends and shelter; but Simon was turned
adrift in a strange country, in the face of a blinding
snow-storm, without a horse or blanket, and with
only one load in his rifle to bring him subsistence.
If that load failed him he would be in a predicament
indeed, for his revolvers would be next to useless in
hunting. They were intended only for short-range
shooting, and such game as he would fall in with&mdash;if
he was fortunate enough to fall in with any&mdash;would
be wary and hard to approach, and could only
be reached by a long-range rifle. It was at least one
hundred and twenty-five miles to the Fort, and that
was the nearest place at which Simon could procure
food.</p>

<p>As soon as Simon was out of sight, Archie, who
knew that there was nothing to be gained by sitting
still and mourning over their hard fate, jumped to
his feet and began to stir around. He set to work
to gather up all the wheels and weights that had
been scattered about when Zack demolished the
machine that had been found in the trunk. His
companions joined him in the search, and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the Pike himself mustered up energy enough to lend
his assistance. His wife and son sat still and stared
at the ruins of their furniture.</p>

<p>“Is this contrivance of yours, whatever it is, patented?”
asked Archie, who thought the old man
might be induced to cheer up a little if he could be
engaged in conversation.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I was going to use it to run my quartz-mill.”</p>

<p>“O, this is only a model, then!”</p>

<p>“Yes. I accidentally found a rich gold-mine
while I was in California, two years ago, but it could
not be developed, because there was no power there
to run a mill. It would have cost a fortune to sink
wells through the rock and bring a steam-engine
over the mountains from Placer city; but this invention
of mine could have been put up in a week or
ten days, and would have furnished power enough
to run a dozen mills. Just think of it! I should
have had that gold-mine all to myself, and there is
no telling how rich it is. Why, you can see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
veins in the rock as thick as your finger. I am
now sixty-five years old, and I have worked at this
invention ever since I was twenty. I got it done
just at the right time, too, and now I must lose all
my work.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. The machinery is all here, and
can be put together again. It doesn’t look as if it
were damaged at all. What motive-power are you
going to use&mdash;steam or water?”</p>

<p>“Nary one. The invention furnishes its own
power.”</p>

<p>It was wonderful what a change these few words
made in the boys’ feelings towards the old man.
The wheels and weights, which they had before
handled so carefully, were bundled promiscuously
together and thrown into one of the wagons. They
had no more time to waste with the machine or with
the inventor, either. A man who could squander
forty-five years of the one life he had to live, in
studying perpetual motion, was not just the sort of
person they wanted to associate with in an emergency
like the present.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>“Let the machine go,” whispered Eugene. “It
isn’t worth the trouble it has caused us. Let’s tell
the old fellow that we’re going to start for the Fort,
and that if he wants to go with us, he had better be
getting ready.”</p>

<p>Archie, who was always expected to speak for
his companions, accordingly informed the Pike that
it was high time they were making a move in some
direction, unless they wanted to stay there and be
snowed up; told him that he and his friends proposed
making an immediate start for the Fort, and
asked him if he wished to accompany them. The
old man said he did, but he had no suggestions to
make, and indeed seemed to take but little interest
in the matter. He was too busy trying to put his
machine together again. The boys, in great disgust,
turned from him to his wife, who, as Featherweight
afterward declared, was the only man in the family.
The Pike himself was plainly crazy, and Reuben
was as stupid as a block.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Holmes, we don’t want to stay here and
freeze,” said Archie, “so we’re going to try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
reach Fort Bolton. We shall find friends there.
It is a long journey to make on foot, but of course
you would rather attempt it than stay here alone.”</p>

<p>“In course I would,” said the woman.</p>

<p>“Then I suggest that we cut up one of these
oxen, and that you cook as much of the meat as we
can carry. We’ll build you a good fire, and while
you are at work, we’ll bundle up the best of these
quilts and blankets, and put the rest of your baggage
in the wagons. It will then be protected from
the weather, and you will know where to find it in
case you should ever want to come after it. But
we have no time to waste. We ought to make at
least eight or ten miles on our way before dark.”</p>

<p>“You, Rube,” exclaimed the woman, suddenly,
“get up an’ go to work. Your pop’s machine is
played out, our million dollars is up stump, an’ we
bein’ poor people agin, you’ve got to scratch with
the rest of us. Git up; you’ve been settin’ thar
like a lump on a log long enough.”</p>

<p>These words seemed to put a little life into
Reuben. He found a knife and went to work at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
one of the oxen; Fred and Archie gathered a
supply of wood and started a fire; while Eugene
employed himself in tying up the quilts and blankets.
Everybody was busy except the old man, who was
still wasting his time with his machine.</p>

<p>While the boys were at work they found opportunity,
now and then, to glance up at the threatening
clouds above them, and they shivered involuntarily
and looked askance at one another when they
thought of the long journey before them. It was
evident that a furious storm was raging, although
they did not feel it, being securely sheltered by the
cliffs. But little snow fell where they were, the
gale carrying it across the gorge above their heads;
but when it came down to them, as it did now and
then, when brought by an eddying wind, it fell in a
blinding shower, and gave them some idea of what
must be the state of affairs on the exposed prairie.</p>

<p>After two hours’ hard work, Archie announced
that they were ready to begin their journey. The
Pike’s wife had cooked a supply of meat sufficient
to last three or four days, and they had also been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
able to save from the wreck enough corn-meal and
flour to make about half a bushel of “slap-jacks,”
which had been baked before the fire on heated
stones. Although the old man seemed to be very
much interested in his work, he kept an eye on all
that was going on, and when he saw that preparations
for the start were being made, he packed his
machine carefully away in a blanket which he had
selected for the purpose, shouldered the bundle
Archie pointed out to him and marched cheerfully
off with the others. He began to act more like himself
now. He had discovered that a few hours’
work would make his machine just as good as it
was before.</p>

<p>Archie, who was leading the way, had not gone
many rods before he told himself that their attempt
to reach the Fort was certain to prove a failure.
He knew that the storm was a hard one, but he
had only a faint idea of its fury until he had
fairly left the shelter of the cliffs. In the first
gully they entered the snow covered the ground
to the depth of three or four inches, and in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
places had been whirled into drifts that reached
almost to the tops of his boots. The main
gully&mdash;the one that led to the valley in which the
wild horse had been captured&mdash;was even worse.
If the storm continued twenty-four hours longer,
it would be quite impassable. They kept bravely
on, carrying the crying children by turns and
shifting their heavy bundles from one shoulder
to the other, until they came within sight of the
prairie, and there they stopped. It was folly to
think of going farther.</p>

<p>Fred and Eugene were appalled at the sight
presented to their gaze, and Archie, who had
witnessed many a New England snow-storm, declared
that he had never seen anything like it. They
could not see twenty yards in any direction, except
down the gully from which they had just emerged.
Everything was concealed by the drifting snow.
The wind blew a gale, and the boys could not face
it for a moment. Fred and Eugene shielded their
eyes with their arms and looked at Archie to see
what he thought about it.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>“I am afraid to try it,” said the former. “The
snow cuts like a knife. I never saw anything like
this in Louisiana. I am so cold already that I can
scarcely talk.”</p>

<p>“We can’t try it,” said Archie; “it is out of the
question. We could not go a quarter of a mile
against this wind to save our lives. Besides, just as
soon as we got out of sight of the mountains, which
would be in less than two minutes, we should lose
our way and that would be the last of us. We must
go back and wait until the storm is over.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing this decision, Fred and Eugene
quickly retreated to the gully, where the Pike and
his family had already taken refuge, while Archie
followed more leisurely, glancing back at the prairie
occasionally, looking up at the clouds, as if trying
to judge of the probable duration of the storm, and
then fastening his eyes on the ground, as if revolving
some problem in his mind.</p>

<p>“We’re snowed up,” said he, when he joined his
companions again. “I was afraid of it, but it is
nothing we can help, so we must make the best of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
We must go back to the wagons. That is the most
sheltered spot I know of. Hadn’t you better go
ahead and build up the fire?” he added, turning to
the Pike, who was shaking like a man with the ague.
“Your children will perish if you keep them out
here. We will follow you as soon as we leave something
to guide our friends, who will be certain to
hunt us up in a few days.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="small">THE SILENT WITNESS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Meanwhile</span> Dick Lewis and those of the
Club who remained at the Fort, were awaiting
the return of the wanderers with no little impatience.
Dick, who knew almost to an hour how
long they ought to be gone, exhibited no anxiety
until the sixth day, and then he began to be uneasy.
He made frequent trips to the summit of a high
swell near the Fort, gazed long and earnestly in the
direction the boys had gone, looked dubiously at
the clouds, and was always moody and silent when
he returned to the camp. On one occasion, when
he had been on the lookout nearly all day, he was
met by George Le Dell, who seemed to be greatly
excited about something.</p>

<p>“What is it, youngster?” exclaimed the trapper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
“Your face says you’ve got news of some sort for
me.”</p>

<p>“Come with me and see for yourself,” replied
George. “I may be mistaken, and certainly hope
I am. I haven’t said a word about it, for I didn’t
want to excite any unnecessary alarm.”</p>

<p>George, followed by the trapper, made a wide
circuit around the camp, and entering the grove
from the opposite side, walked into it a short distance,
and then stopped and pointed to a horse
which was hitched to one of the trees.</p>

<p>“I found him feeding with my horse, and
brought him in here to keep him until you came”
said George. “I hope I have made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Wal, you hain’t,” said the trapper, bluntly.
“That’s leetle Fred’s hoss, if I ever seed him.
Something’s happened to them keerless fellers.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was afraid of,” said George, an
expression of anxiety settling on his face. “You
see he has a piece of rawhide rope around his neck.
He never broke that.”</p>

<p>“In course he didn’t,” said the trapper. “I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
a notion to tell ole Bob to give me a good wallopin’
fur lettin’ ’em go. The snow’ll be four foot deep
afore this time to-morrow, an’ something’s got to be
done, right quick.”</p>

<p>As the trapper spoke he untied the horse and led
him through the grove to the camp. Uncle Dick
and all the boys were there, and, as may be imagined,
the trapper’s appearance created no little
commotion among them. They recognised Fred’s
horse at once.</p>

<p>“Thar hain’t no need of wastin’ time an’ words
over it,” said Dick, hurriedly. “This hoss’s lariat
has been cut with a knife, an’ he’s come home.
Fred didn’t cut it himself, in course; so something’s
happened to them boys, an’ me an’ Bob’s got to see
about it, to onct. We’d oughter gone two days
ago. I kinder felt it in my bones.”</p>

<p>The Club and Uncle Dick said plainly enough
by their actions that if the trappers were going to
look for the missing boys, they were not going
alone. A general rush was made for bridles,
saddles and weapons, and confusion reigned supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
until Uncle Dick took the management of affairs
into his own hands. Two of the boys were directed
to hitch the mules to the wagon, drive them up to
the Fort and request permission of the colonel to
leave them there until they should be called for;
another was instructed to strike the tent and pack
it away in the wagon; another to get out a supply
of bacon, hard-tack and coffee sufficient to last them
a week; and the two trappers to saddle the horses.
Uncle Dick himself bundled up the blankets; and
order being thus established, and each one having
a certain duty to perform, everything was done
in a very short space of time.</p>

<p>Colonel Gaylord readily promised to take charge
of such of the Club’s property as they wished to
leave behind, and took the trouble to come down to
camp to see what the matter was. When he had
heard Uncle Dick’s story, he generously offered him
a squad of cavalry to assist in hunting up the boys,
but the trappers said they didn’t need it.</p>

<p>In half an hour the whole party were in the saddle
and the Fort was out of sight. Frank Nelson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
of course, led the way. He went at such a rate of
speed that the foot-hills were reached a little after
midnight, and there Dick Lewis ordered a halt.
The storm was by this time fairly under way, and
a terrible one it was, too. Walter and the rest of
the boys from Louisiana, who had never experienced
anything of the kind before, were amazed at its violence,
and even Uncle Dick and the two trappers,
who had “roughed it” all their lives, said it was
something rather out of the ordinary. It continued
all night, and the next morning the little hollows
between the swells were filled with snow. The wind
seemed to blow with redoubled force as the day advanced,
but it was at their backs, and by keeping
close along the edge of the hills, Uncle Dick and
his party were in some measure protected from its
fury. They were all warmly clad and suffered but
little from the cold. They did not stop again until
near the middle of the afternoon, and then a circumstance
happened which gave the Club an opportunity
to gain some idea of the wonderful skill in woodcraft
possessed by their two backwoods companions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Dick Lewis, who was riding by Frank’s side, suddenly
drew rein, turned his horse’s head toward the
willows which lined the base of the hills, and after
snuffing the air a few times, looked inquiringly at
old Bob. The latter nodded his head and Dick
exclaimed: “It hain’t fur off. We must go back.”</p>

<p>“What isn’t far off, and why must we go back?”
asked George.</p>

<p>“I smell smoke,” replied Dick.</p>

<p>The boys looked at one another a moment, but
none of them could understand the matter.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll tell you what’s a fact,” said Perk.
“Suppose you do smell smoke; what of it?”</p>

<p>“Why thar’s a fire around here somewhere,”
answered the trapper; “an’ whar thar’s a fire thar
must have been somebody to set it agoin’.”</p>

<p>The boys understood it now, and exhibited no
little surprise. They snuffed the air repeatedly, but
their senses were not as keen as those of the trappers,
and they could detect no smell of smoke. But
Dick and old Bob could, and they followed it up
with all the sagacity of a brace of hounds. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
skirted the hills for a quarter of a mile or more,
breasting the fierce wind which almost took their
breath away, and then Dick suddenly reined his
horse into the willows. He kept straight ahead,
turning neither to the right nor left, and presently
brought his companions within sight of the fire.</p>

<p>The boys were greatly disappointed. They had
confidently expected to find Archie and his friends
there, but they saw no one except a solitary stranger,
who was doubled up over a small bed of coals,
rubbing his palms together and shaking violently
in every limb. His hands and face were blue with
cold. He glanced up as they approached, and then
looked down into the fire again.</p>

<p>“Hallo, stranger!” cried Dick. “Whar mought
you be a travellin’ to?”</p>

<p>“I’m lost,” was the faint reply, “an’ starvin’ an’
freezin’.”</p>

<p>“Sho!” exclaimed the trapper; “freezin’ with a
fire in front of you an’ all this timber around you!”</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Uncle Dick, “unpack the provisions,
a couple of you, and the rest of us cut some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
wood. This poor fellow is so nearly benumbed that
he can’t keep his fire going.”</p>

<p>A few minutes’ work made a great change in the
appearance of the stranger’s camp. Three or four
small trees had been cut down for the horses to
browse upon; the fire was roaring cheerfully; a
coffee-pot and several slices of bacon were spattering
on the coals; and the bushes and saplings had been
cleared away for a space of twenty feet or more,
and piled on one side of the camp to protect it from
the fury of the wind. The kind-hearted and
thoughtful George, noticing that the stranger’s well-worn
clothing was but a poor protection against the
wintry blasts, had thrown a pair of heavy blankets
over his shoulders; but he was so cold that he
hugged the fire long after all the rest had begun to
back away from it. The boys were eager to hear
how he came there, but old Bob restrained their
impatience. “A man that’s hungry an’ half froze
can’t talk,” said he. “Wait till he gets warmed up
with a pot or two of hot coffee, an’ stows away a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
pounds of them bacon an’ crackers, an’ his tongue
will run lively enough, I tell you.”</p>

<p>The old trapper was mistaken for once, however.
The stranger emptied his cup as fast as it was filled
for him, and disposed of three men’s share of the
bacon and biscuits, but they seemed to have no effect
on his tongue. He was as dumb as a wooden man,
and seemed uneasy in the presence of those who had
fed and warmed him.</p>

<p>At length Uncle Dick began questioning him,
telling him also that if he would let them know
where he wanted to go the trappers would put him
on his course; and furthermore, they would give
him provisions enough to last him until he reached
his destination. He finally succeeded in getting
the stranger started on his story, which he told in
such a way that none of his auditors believed a
word of it. He said he had belonged to a wagon-train
which had been attacked by the Indians.
The most of the emigrants had been massacred, all
the stock driven off and he had barely escaped with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
his life. It happened a week ago, and he had had
nothing to eat since.</p>

<p>Uncle Dick and his party heard him through,
and then settled back and looked their disbelief.
If there had been any Indian depredations during
the week that had just passed, Colonel Gaylord
would not have been ignorant of the fact, and they
would have been certain to have heard of it through
him. The impression at once became general that
the man had been doing something that would not
bear investigation, else why had he trumped up
such a story? They made no remark, however,
and it is probable that the stranger would have been
permitted to go his way without any further questioning
or offers of assistance from them, had it not
been for one little circumstance. There was a witness
against him which he had not thought of, and
Frank was the one who discovered it. The latter,
who was sitting on the opposite side of the fire with
his hands clasping his knees, suddenly straightened
up and looked closely at something lying on the
ground by the stranger’s side. Presently he arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
and walking over to him, laid hold of the object,
which was concealed from the view of the others
by the blankets that George Le Dell had thrown
over the man’s shoulders. As he made an effort to
lift it, the stranger seized it and held it fast. The
expression on Frank’s face brought the Club to their
feet in a twinkling.</p>

<p>“Let go,” said Frank, earnestly. “I want to
see what you’ve got here.”</p>

<p>“It’s mine,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>“Well, I must see it and know how you came by
it. Let go.”</p>

<p>The man still held fast to the object, whatever it
was, and Frank, seizing it with both hands wrenched
it out of his grasp, jerking off the blankets at the
same time, and bringing to light a Maynard rifle&mdash;the
mate to his own. It was so much like it, in fact,
that when the rifles were first purchased by the
cousins, they could never tell them apart until they
had had their names engraved on them. Frank
was so well acquainted with the weapon that he
would have known it had he seen it in Asia. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
turned it up, and there was Archie’s name on the
butt-plate. He read the name aloud, and the boys
flocked about him with exclamations of wonder,
each one taking the rifle into his own hands and
giving it a good looking over. It was so unexpected,
this finding of Archie’s property in the possession
of a stranger, that they wanted the evidence
of their own eyes before they could believe it.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll just tell you what’s a fact,” said Perk,
who was the first to speak, “you’ve been up to
something. Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Hand out the cartridges,” said Frank, finding
that there was an empty shell in the chamber of the
rifle.</p>

<p>“What’s that thar stickin’ out thar?” exclaimed
old Bob, suddenly.</p>

<p>Bob pushed away the stranger’s leg and snatched
up a belt containing two revolvers. They were
Eugene’s, and every one about the fire recognised
them.</p>

<p>“You’ve been up to something, I tell you,” said
Perk.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>“Hand out the cartridges,” repeated Frank.</p>

<p>“I hain’t got none,” replied Simon Cool, for it
was he. “I didn’t have but one load for the rifle,
and I tried to get something to eat with that.”</p>

<p>“When did you last see the boys who own these
things?” asked Uncle Dick.</p>

<p>“Two days ago.”</p>

<p>“How many of them were they, and were they
all right?”</p>

<p>Simon replied that there were three of them, and
that the last time he saw them they were safe and
sound, and in no danger of suffering from cold or
hunger; and then, in obedience to Uncle Dick’s
command, went on to tell his story&mdash;the true story
this time&mdash;to which his auditors listened with much
more attention than they had given when he related
his first one. He told everything just as we have
told it, and when his story was ended, Dick Lewis
declared that they had rested long enough, and
ordered an immediate start.</p>

<p>The sorrow which Simon Cool pretended to feel
for the wrong he had done, did not secure his release,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
as he had hoped it would. Uncle Dick did
not know how much faith to put in him. They
might not find the boys where Simon said he had
left them; or if they did find them, they might not
be all right after all. Then, too, they might have
more to tell than Simon had seen fit to disclose;
and taking all these things into consideration, Uncle
Dick decided that the man should be detained until
they had opportunity to satisfy themselves of the
truth of his statements.</p>

<p>Frank’s horse, being the largest and strongest
animal in the party, was given over to Dick Lewis,
who took Simon up behind him and carried him during
the rest of the journey. So impatient were they
all to find the missing boys, that their halts were
few and far between, and they made such good
headway, in spite of the snow-drifts, that they
reached the mouth of the gully on the afternoon
of the second day after the finding of Simon Cool.
The gully was filled with snow, and as it had not
been recently disturbed, they knew that the boys
were still finding shelter under the cliffs.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>While Dick and Bob were breaking a road for the
horses, the former, whose eyes were everywhere,
called Frank’s attention to something. It was a
smooth, bare spot on a beech tree, from which the
bark had been cleared by a knife or hatchet.
Frank became excited at once. He floundered
through a deep drift, brushed the snow off the tree,
and calling the attention of his companions, read
aloud the following, which had been written with a
lead-pencil:</p>

<p>“Nov. 12th.&mdash;All well and hearty, but don’t like
being weather-bound. If we must be snowed up
again, should rather have it done in summer. Take
the first right-hand gully, then the <i>next</i> right-hand
one, and you will find us before you have gone a
quarter of a mile.”</p>

<p>“Well, the boys are in good heart,” said Uncle
Dick, and the long breath that came up from his
broad chest showed the relief he felt.</p>

<p>“I knowed we’d find them keerless fellers all
right,” said Dick Lewis.</p>

<p>“And here’s something else that I can’t quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
make out,” said Frank, still studying the writing
on the tree. “Archie always writes a horrible hand
when he’s in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps his fingers were cold,” said Walter.</p>

<p>“It is dated November <a href="#Page_16">16</a>,” continued Frank.</p>

<p>“That was yesterday,” said Uncle Dick, with
some uneasiness. “No bad news, I hope. Try and
make it out if you can.”</p>

<p>Frank lightly brushed off the snow, taking care
not to erase the pencil-marks, and then slowly read,
spelling out each word, a sentence that created as
great a commotion as a thunderbolt would have
done, had it suddenly fallen into the midst of the
party:</p>

<p>“We have found Chase, and he is well.”</p>

<p>“<i>What!</i>” cried Uncle Dick.</p>

<p>“That’s what I make it,” said Frank, breaking
away from the tree to make room for Perk and the
rest of the boys, who came plunging through the
drift. “I shouldn’t wonder if your missing friend
had turned up at last.”</p>


<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="caption">

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he has!” exclaimed Bob, after he had
closely examined the writing; “hasn’t he, Perk?”</p>

<p>Perk took a look, then Walter and George,
and each declared that Frank’s rendering of the
obscure sentence was the correct one. The boys
were so surprised and delighted that they could
scarcely speak.</p>

<p>“Well! well! I never will be surprised at anything
again,” said Uncle Dick. “There are some
people away off in Louisiana who would give something
to know what we know now. Push ahead,
Lewis. You can’t go any too fast for us.”</p>

<p>“Look a yer,” said Simon Cool, suddenly.
“Seein’ you’ve found your friends, mightn’t you as
well turn me loose?”</p>

<p>“Why, man, you would freeze or starve,” said
Bob.</p>

<p>“I kin take keer of myself,” replied Simon, who,
it was plain, would much rather have taken his
chances on the prairie than face those whom he had
wronged.</p>

<p>“We have another story to listen to before we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
take leave of you,” said Uncle Dick. “Climb up,
boys, and we’ll be off.”</p>

<p>The whole party were in their saddles in two
minutes more, and riding down the gully as fast as
the deep snow-drifts would permit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="small">THE STOWAWAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Turn</span> we now to follow, briefly, the fortunes of
Henry Chase, who had for so many months
been an object of solicitude to the old members of the
Sportsman’s Club, and the rest of his friends living
in Louisiana.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that when this young gentleman
and his crony, Wilson, were first introduced to
the reader, they were not on the best of terms with
Walter and his party. They belonged to Bayard
Bell’s boat-club, made common cause with him in
everything, and on one occasion came to an open
rupture with the crew of the Zephyr, and might have
got into a fight with them, had it not been for the
timely arrival of Mr. Gaylord and Uncle Dick.
This happened on the day of the panther-hunt, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
was the beginning of the adventures we have attempted
to describe in the <i>Sportsman’s Club Series</i>.</p>

<p>Shortly after that, on the very same day in fact,
some things came to light which made a wonderful
change in the feelings of these two boys. They
found that the unreasonable enmity which Bayard
cherished toward the members of the Sportsman’s
Club was likely to get him, and all connected with
him, into serious trouble; so they abruptly deserted
him, and made an attempt to warn Walter Gaylord
of the plans that were being laid against him. They
failed in their efforts, however, and got themselves
into a scrape; and there is no telling what might
have become of Chase, had not the Sportsman’s Club
fortunately discovered him hidden away under a
pile of leaves on Lost Island, where the smugglers
had left him, and rendered him assistance. Wilson
was Chase’s steadfast friend; and to show their gratitude
to the Club, he and Chase joined their vessel,
the Banner, and accompanied them to Cuba, to assist
in rescuing Fred Craven, who was a prisoner on
board the Stella, of which Mr. Bell was the owner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
They bore an important part in that memorable expedition,
and when left in charge of the vessel by
Walter, were decoyed away by a note written by Mr.
Bell’s directions, and sent out into the country, to
the house of one Don Casper Nevis, the agent whose
business it was to receive the arms and ammunition
that were smuggled into the island for the use of the
Cuban rebels. While on the way to the Don’s
house they were seen, suspected and watched by a
squad of government patrols, who made an attempt
to arrest them; but they were saved by their host,
who concealed them in a wine-cellar until dark,
and then brought them out, and made ready to furnish
them with horses to take them back to Port
Platte.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that the Don had all the while
been under a wrong impression in regard to the
character of the two boys who were his guests. A
note, which was brought to him by the negro who
had acted as a guide to Chase and Wilson, and
which was written by Captain Conway, the master
of Mr. Bell’s smuggling schooner, led the Don to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
believe that the boys belonged to the Stella, and
that they had been sent out there to make arrangements
in regard to the landing of her contraband
cargo. Chase tried to correct this wrong impression,
and to explain to the Don how they came to
be in Cuba, and the consequence was that he got
himself and Wilson into a worse predicament than
they had ever been in before. The Don was highly
enraged, and refused to believe a word of their
story. He accused them of being Spanish spies,
who had been sent out to his house on purpose to
give the patrols some excuse for arresting him,
declared that he would take them forthwith before
Captain Conway, and if he could not vouch for
them, they might make up their minds that some
terrible punishment would be visited upon them.
The Don then went after the horses, and Chase and
Wilson were left in charge of his overseer, who had
orders to shoot them down if they attempted to
escape.</p>

<p>The boys both realized that they were in a very
unenviable situation, and the question was how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
get out of it. Captain Conway would not vouch
for them, that was certain. He would declare that
he had never seen them before, and that would be
all that was needed to confirm the Don’s suspicions.
Then what would become of them? Wilson was
disposed to trust to luck, but Chase had more confidence
in his legs. He resolved to run away, leaving
Walter and the rest to look out for themselves,
and make all haste to get out of Cuba. He would
ship on the first vessel he could find, no matter if
she took him to South America. He waited anxiously
for an opportunity to slip away from the
overseer, and it was quickly presented to him.</p>

<p>Tomlinson and the rest of the deserters from the
revenue cutter, who had stolen a passage to Cuba
in the Banner, appeared on the scene about this
time, the object of their visit to the plantation
being to procure the provisions necessary to serve
them during their voyage to Havana, where they
expected to join a Cuban privateer. While these
worthies were forcing an entrance into the storehouse,
and Wilson and the overseer were watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
them, Chase slipped away in the darkness. Had
he waited two minutes longer, he might have
escaped in company with his friend. Wilson also
eluded the vigilance of the overseer, went on board
the Banner which was anchored in the bay, and
with her returned to the States in time to take
part in the Christmas festivities at the hospitable
Gaylord mansion; but Chase became a wanderer
upon the face of the earth, and was not even heard
of for nearly a year.</p>

<p>Chase moved very slowly and cautiously until he
was out of sight of the overseer, and then he ran as
he had never run before. His first object was to
put a safe distance between himself and the storehouse;
and when that had been done, he made a
wide circuit to avoid the dwelling and the Spanish
troopers who were keeping guard over it, and at last
reached the road which led to the village of Port
Platte. Then he slackened his pace to a rapid walk
and began to breathe easier. His escape had been
easily accomplished, and now he had only to go to
the town and find some ship that was to sail at once;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
the sooner the better, if he were but allowed to get
fairly over the side. If she were bound for the
States, well and good; but rather than remain
longer in Cuba he would ship on a vessel bound for
Greenland. Life in the forecastle or among the
icebergs was much to be preferred to a longer
sojourn in such a country as this, where every man
suspected his neighbor, and Spanish troopers were
always ready to arrest people for the most trivial
causes and shoot them down without ceremony.
Chase wished now that he had not read the papers
quite so attentively. Every act of cruelty which he
had seen recorded came to his mind with startling
distinctness, and stayed there too, in spite of all his
efforts to banish it. He began to miss his friend
Wilson already. The latter had been cheerful and
hopeful in spite of all their misfortunes, and his
example and words of encouragement had done much
to keep up Chase’s drooping spirits. He would
have given something now to have had anybody for
companion, for it was anything but pleasant to be
friendless and alone in that strange country. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
road and by-way was guarded by patrols, and what
if he should happen to fall into the hands of some
of them? He could only account for his presence
in Cuba by telling a very improbable story, and if
the patrols should refuse to believe it, and he could
not find Walter and the rest to prove what he said,
he might perhaps be detained and punished as a spy.</p>

<p>“I wish I had never seen or heard of the Sportsman’s
Club,” said Chase, for the twentieth time.
“They’ve got themselves and me into a pretty
scrape, and there is no one to be benefited by it.
I’d give something to know what has become of the
rest of the fellows. I’ll warrant that I’ll see home
before they will.”</p>

<p>The moon began to struggle through the clouds
now&mdash;it was just about this time that Wilson
was running his race with Pierre for the yawl&mdash;and
this was a point in Chase’s favor, for it enabled him
to see every object in the road in advance of him.
He kept a bright lookout for the dreaded patrols,
and was ready to take to the bushes at the first sight
of a horseman; but the guards, which had been as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
plenty as blackberries during the day-time, were not
to be seen, and Chase accomplished his ten mile
walk without meeting anybody. The plantation
houses along the road were as dark and silent as if
they had been deserted, and even the dogs, which
had greeted him and Wilson so vociferously when
they passed that way in the day-time, were neither
seen nor heard.</p>

<p>The road led Chase straight to the wide, arched
gateway which opened upon the wharf near the
place where the Banner was moored when he last
saw her. The Spanish brig was still there, and
Chase hurriedly clambered over her rail and ran to
the opposite side. He did not expect to find Walter’s
vessel there, and consequently he was neither
surprised nor disappointed when he found that her
berth was empty. The gallant little Banner, under
the charge of her lawful captain, who had recovered
her in a most unexpected manner, was at that moment
running out of the bay at the rear of the Don’s
plantation, having safely passed the iron-clad frigate
that had been sent in pursuit of her.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>“Aha!” said Chase, in a triumphant tone, “I
knew I wasn’t quite so foolish as some people gave
me credit for. Won’t Wilson be in a nice fix when
he comes here with the Don? He expects to find
the Banner here, and is relying upon Walter and
the rest to prove who he is and how he came here;
but he’ll not find them, and I knew he wouldn’t. I
wouldn’t be in his boots for anything. Why didn’t
he run away when I did?”</p>

<p>Chase, congratulating himself on having shown
no small degree of shrewdness and generalship in
the way he had managed matters during the last
few hours, turned to go back to the wharf. One
of the brig’s crew who recognised him, and who
knew by his actions that he was looking for the
Banner, addressed a few words to him, waving his
arm toward the Gulf and saying “boom! boom!”
a great many times. He was trying to explain to
the boy that the Banner had gone out, and that she
had been fired at by the guns of the Fort; but
Chase could not understand a word he said, and believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
that the sailor was making game of him, he
sprang over the brig’s side and hurried away.</p>

<p>His first care was to satisfy himself that the
Stella still occupied her old berth, and that none of
her company were roaming about the wharf. Chase
had learned to stand in wholesome fear of Mr.
Bell and his gang of smugglers, and he did not care
to meet any of them again if he could help it.
But Mr. Bell was no longer in a situation to do him
any injury, if he had only known it. If he had
approached close enough to the Stella he must have
gained some idea of the state of affairs, for he would
have seen the soldiers on her deck. He <i>did</i> see a
number of men walking about, but he was too far
away to see their uniforms, and believing that the
moving figures were members of her crew on watch,
he hurried away as fast as his legs could carry him,
to find a vessel that was about to sail.</p>

<p>“And what if I shouldn’t happen to find one?”
Chase almost gasped, a new and most unwelcome
thought suddenly forcing itself upon him. “In a
little out-of-the-way port like this, vessels can’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
coming and going at all hours of the day and night,
and if I can’t get off, where shall I sleep, and where
shall I go in the morning to get something to eat?”</p>

<p>Chase was called upon more than once to decide
such questions as these before he saw home and friends
again. Indeed, there were a few weeks of his life
during which the finding of food to sustain life, and
a shelter of some kind to protect him while he slept,
about which he had never before bothered his head,
were matters that occupied every one of his waking
hours. But on this occasion fortune seemed to favor
him. A few steps from the Spanish brig lay a ship
which Chase had noticed during the day. It was
then being loaded, and the anxiety manifested by
the officers to get the freight aboard as rapidly as
possible, indicated that she was about to leave port.
Toward this vessel Chase bent his steps, and he was
overjoyed to find that the loading was all done, and
that preparations were being made to take her to
sea. Some of the lines were already cast off, and a
couple of men in a yawl were making an effort to
tow her bow out from the wharf. Chase had arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
just in time. He made all haste to get on board,
and while he was looking about for the captain, to
whom he wished to make known his desires, he was
accosted by a bustling little man in a red shirt and
wide trowsers, who proved to be the second mate of
the vessel.</p>

<p>“Now, then, what do you want here?” exclaimed
that gentleman. “Off you go. We’re going to sea
at once.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” replied Chase. “I want
to ship.”</p>

<p>“Too late,” said the mate. “Got a full crew
already. Lay aft, a couple of you,” he added, as
a hoarse voice shouted out some orders from the
quarter-deck. “If you are not ashore in half a
minute, my lad, you’ll have to go with us.”</p>

<p>The mate hurried away to attend to his duties,
and Chase, who would have tried to gain his ear a
moment longer, was left to himself.</p>

<p>“Where are you bound?” he asked of a man
who at that moment ran past him&mdash;“for the States?”</p>

<p>The sailor, whose actions indicated that he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
time to waste in answering foolish questions, made
a motion with his head, the significance of which
was very doubtful; but Chase took it for a reply in
the affirmative, and his mind was made up on the
instant. Here was the opportunity he had been
longing for, and the only thing that prevented him
from taking advantage of it, was the fact that the
crew was full. But that made no difference to
Chase. His circumstances were desperate, and in
his opinion desperate measures were required. Instead
of going ashore, as he had been ordered to do,
he looked about the deck, and having made sure
that all the crew, from the captain down, were too
busy to pay any attention to himself, he suddenly
crouched down beside one of the boats that had been
stowed in the waist, and crawled under it out of
sight.</p>

<p>“There!” panted Chase, whose heart beat violently
with excitement and suspense; “if I can only
stay here five minutes without being discovered, I
shall be all right. They’ll not stop to put me ashore
after they once get fairly started. I don’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
what the captain will say to me when he finds me
here, and I don’t care, so long as he gives me
plenty to eat and takes me to my own country. It
is enough for me to know that I am leaving Cuba
behind every minute.”</p>

<p>Chase was securely hidden under the boat, and
not one of the crew, who were constantly passing
his hiding-place, suspected his presence. The work
of hoisting the sails was completed at last, and
finally the vessel began to rise and fall with a slow
regular motion, telling the stowaway that she had
left the sheltered waters, of the harbor, and was
fairly afloat on the Gulf.</p>

<p>And now came a task which Chase would have
been glad to postpone indefinitely if he could. He
must come out and show himself to the captain.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="small">A LONG WAY HOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Chase</span> remained in his concealment for a long
time, trying to make up some plausible story
to tell the captain in reply to the rigid cross-examination
which he knew he would have to undergo
when he first appeared before that gentleman.
The captain would, of course, want to know how
he came to be in Cuba, and why he was in so great
a hurry to leave it, and Chase did not expect him
to believe the story he had to tell. The captain of
the revenue cutter had refused to believe it when
Walter told it to him; Don Casper had pronounced
it false; and it was reasonable to suppose that the
master of the ship would do the same. But it was
all true, no matter whether people thought so or
not; and Chase finally making up his mind that
truth would hold its own with falsehood any day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
abandoned the idea of making up a story, and resolved
to tell just what had occurred, leaving the
captain to do as he pleased about believing it. He
would do it at once, too. The sooner it was over
and he knew what was to be done with him, the
better he would feel.</p>

<p>With this thought in his mind Chase arose quickly
from his concealment, bumping his head against the
side of the boat as he did so, and when he got upon
his feet, found himself standing face to face with
the second mate, who started back and looked at
him, being too surprised to speak. Believing that
when the officer recovered himself the first words
he uttered would be a volley of oaths, Chase
hastened to account for his presence by saying:</p>

<p>“You told me that if I didn’t go ashore I would
have to sail with you, and I thought, from the way
you said it, that you wouldn’t be very angry if I
<i>should</i> go with you. I want to work my passage
home.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a go,” said the officer, looking all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
around the vessel and then fastening his eyes on
Chase again.</p>

<p>“I shan’t be any expense to you,” continued the
boy, “for I am able to earn the food I eat. I don’t
know anything about square-rigged vessels, but I
know something about schooner-rigged yachts, and
I can stand my trick at the wheel with almost anybody.”</p>

<p>While Chase was talking the mate had time to
collect himself. He walked to the side of the
vessel, threw out his quid of tobacco, and then came
back. His words were not very reassuring, but the
tone in which they were uttered delighted Chase,
for it satisfied him that if all the officers of the
ship were like this one, he had nothing to fear.</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to throw you overboard,”
said the mate. “You ran away from home to be a
sailor, did you? And you’re sick of your bargain
too, are you? It serves you just right,” he added,
with a glance at the boy’s white hands and broadcloth
suit, the latter beginning to show the effects
of the hard treatment it had received during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
last few days. “You’ll stay at home with your
mother when you get there again, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t run away,” said Chase, as soon as he
saw a chance to speak. “I have a good home, and
I am anxious to get back to it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes,” said the mate, with a nod that spoke
volumes. “Home looks very comfortable and
pleasant after one has been away from it a while,
don’t it? Well, the old man’s turned in, and you
can’t see him till to-morrow. I don’t know what to
do with you, so you had better go below, and if
you can find an empty bunk, turn in and go to
sleep.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Chase, gratefully. “I shall
be very glad to do it.”</p>

<p>The boy made his way to the forecastle, feeling
as if a heavy burden had been removed from his
shoulders. Like most people who get their ideas
of men and things solely from books, he had formed
some very erroneous opinions. He had believed
that all sailors, and especially all mates, were
brutes, who asked no better amusement than swearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
at somebody or knocking him down with a
handspike. But here was a mate who was a very
different sort of person, and he was glad indeed
that he had fallen in with him.</p>

<p>The forecastle&mdash;a dark, badly-ventilated apartment
in the forward part of the vessel, smelling of
tar and bilge-water, and dimly lighted by a smoky
lantern&mdash;was not quite as inviting a place to sleep
as his airy room at home, or even the cosy, nicely-furnished
cabin of the Banner; but it was better
than no shelter at all, and Chase thought he could
stand it during the five or six days that would
probably elapse before he reached New Orleans.
Several of the bunks were occupied by the men
belonging to the watch below, and the beds that
were made up in the others showed that they belonged
to the sailors who were on deck. There
were two empty ones, however, in the lowest tier
and in the farthest corner of the forecastle, and of
one of these Chase took possession, blessing his
lucky stars that at last he had an opportunity to
rest his tired limbs. The pine boards that composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
the bottom of the bunk were rather hard,
but he was among his own countrymen, and Mr.
Bell and Cuba were being left farther behind every
moment. Of course he had no bedding, that being
something that every sailor is expected to furnish
for himself. He had his hat for a pillow, and while
he was arranging it under his head, and trying to
find a board in the bottom of the bunk soft enough
to sleep upon, he became aware that a sailor in the
opposite berth was greatly interested in his movements.
Indeed, when he came to look about him,
he found that the eyes of all the men in the forecastle
were directed toward his bunk.</p>

<p>“Well, mates,” said Chase, in an off-hand, easy
manner, which he thought becoming to a sailor, “is
this the first time you ever saw a stowaway?”</p>

<p>“That’s how you came aboard, is it?” said one
of the men. “I thought I hadn’t seen you before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have stolen my passage,” replied Chase.
“I wanted to ship, but they told me they had all
the men they needed. I was bound to leave Cuba,
however, so I hid under the long boat till the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
was well out to sea. The mate sent me down here
till the captain gets ready to see me.”</p>

<p>Chase expected to be the butt of a good many
jokes and smart remarks from the sailors, so when
they began upon him he was prepared to submit.
But, after all, they had nothing very aggravating
to say, and finding that he received their pleasantries
very good-naturedly, they finally desisted and
left him to sleep in peace&mdash;all except the sailor in
the opposite bunk, who seemed to have a larger
share of curiosity than his companions, and showed
a desire to know something of the boy’s history.
He smiled and nodded his head, just as the mate had
done, while he listened to Chase’s account of his recent
adventures, and when the boy finished his story,
asked him where he lived.</p>

<p>“In Bellville, Louisiana,” replied Chase.</p>

<p>“Well, seems to me you’re taking a long way to
get home,” said the sailor, as he pulled the blankets
over his shoulders and turned his face to the bulkhead
preparatory to going to sleep.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>“How is that? One of the crew told me that
the ship is bound for the States.”</p>

<p>“So she is; but she is going by the way of the
Horn and Good Hope.”</p>

<p>“Great goodness! Around the world!” exclaimed
Chase, as soon as he could speak.</p>

<p>The sailor replied that that was what some people
called a voyage of that kind, and then settled himself
between the blankets, while Chase sat bolt upright
in his bunk, staring blankly about him.</p>

<p>“Around the world!” he kept saying to himself,
as if he could not quite understand the words. He
had not bargained for any such extended tour as
that, and he was not prepared for it. Could he live
for long months, and perhaps years, without any
bedding to sleep on, and no clothes except those he
then wore? And what would the folks at home
think had become of him? Poor Chase was almost
overwhelmed at the thought of so long a separation
from his friends, and appalled by the dangers, both
real and imaginary, which he saw looming up before
him; and he wished now, when it was too late, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
he had not been in so great a hurry to get out of
Cuba. He would willingly have gone back to the
Don’s wine-cellar&mdash;he was almost willing to say that
he would rather be a prisoner in the hands of the
Spaniards than be in his present situation. He
never closed his eyes in sleep. All the night long he
rolled about in his bunk, thinking over his troubles;
and he was glad when the morning dawned, and the
mate came into the forecastle to tell him that the
captain wanted to see him on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>Almost too weak and dispirited to move, Chase
managed to follow the officer up the ladder, and in
a few seconds more he was standing, hat in hand,
before the master of the vessel&mdash;a gray-headed old
gentleman, who reminded Chase of Uncle Dick
Gaylord. He proved to be like Uncle Dick, too, in
more respects than one, which was a fortunate thing
for the stowaway. He was evidently prepared to
say something severe, for his forehead wore a
threatening scowl; but when his eyes rested on the
crying youth before him, his face softened at once.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, my lad,” said he, “don’t you know that
you have no business here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Chase.</p>

<p>“What have you to say for yourself?”</p>

<p>The boy had a good deal to say for himself, and
it took him some time to say it, although he related
his story with all haste, touching only on such
portions of it as he thought would interest the captain.
The latter listened patiently, but with evident
surprise, and when Chase ceased speaking, said:</p>

<p>“I saw the yacht you describe, and noticed that
there was a good deal going on aboard of her.
Were you the boy who jumped overboard?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Chase, wondering what the
captain meant.</p>

<p>“Were you on her when she was under the fire
of the fort?”</p>

<p>The boy began to open his eyes now. These
questions made it plain to him that he and Wilson
were not the only ones who had seen excitement and
been in perilous situations during the afternoon.
The rest of the yacht’s company had come in for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
share, but of course Chase knew nothing about it,
for he was ten miles away in the country, and part
of the time locked up in the Don’s wine-cellar.</p>

<p>“As you are here and I can’t well put you ashore,
I shall do the best I can by you,” said the captain.
“Of course you have no outfit?”</p>

<p>“Nothing except the clothes I stand in,” replied
Chase.</p>

<p>“Then you had better sign articles at boy’s
wages, and after that you can go to the slop-chest.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” replied Chase, who did not
quite catch the captain’s meaning. “I suppose I
can do no better.”</p>

<p>“I will discharge you at San Francisco, which
will be the first port in America at which we shall
touch.”</p>

<p>So saying the captain walked down into his cabin,
followed by Chase. The boy signed his name to
the shipping articles, and was then turned over to
the steward, who was told to conduct him to the
slop-chest and give him what he wanted.</p>

<p>“I was in hopes I should be allowed to mess with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
the men,” said Chase, as the steward led him away.
“I am one of the crew now, and I don’t think I
ought to be fed on slops.”</p>

<p>The steward stared at him a moment, and then
broke out into a hearty fit of laughter.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see a ship before?” he asked.</p>

<p>“O, yes,” replied Chase. “I live in a seaport
town.”</p>

<p>“Well, did you never hear that greenhorns
always mess in the crow’s-nest, and that their
skouse and dough-boy are cooked in tar and bilge-water?”</p>

<p>“No, I never did.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is a fact, as you will find. It hardens
their muscles and makes them water-proof.”</p>

<p>Chase simply smiled his disbelief, and followed
the steward below, where the ship’s supplies were
kept. Then he found that the slop-chest was not a
chest after all. It was the ship’s variety store&mdash;a
little locker in which were stowed away an abundance
of mattresses, blankets, trowsers, shirts, pea-jackets,
needles, thread, tobacco and other articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
of necessity and luxury which go to make up a
sailor’s kit.</p>

<p>“O, things are not so bad after all,” thought
Chase, as he gazed at the well-filled shelves.
“They might be a great deal worse. I shall not
freeze while going around the Horn, and neither
shall I starve; and when I am once safe ashore at
San Francisco, it will not be much of a task to
work my way home across the plains. I shall see
something of life and of the world, too. I believe
I’d rather be here than in the Don’s wine-cellar.”</p>

<p>The steward assisted him in making his selections,
charging each article to his account at rather higher
prices than he would have had to pay ashore, and
when he had got all he wanted he carried them to
the forecastle and stowed them away in his bunk.
After that he was ordered into the cabin to assist
the steward, and in two days more was fairly settled
in his new position, and knew how to scour
knives and bang dishes as well as the other cabin-boy.</p>

<p>Before many days had passed over his head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Chase was effectually cured of some very foolish
notions, just as many another deluded boy has
been cured. It may be all very well for those
who go to sea as passengers to write in glowing
terms of the ease and romance of a sailor’s life, but
one who is before the mast, and has the work to do,
must of necessity look at it in a different light.
Chase found it one of drudgery and toil. There
was always something to do, for shipmasters believe
that men cannot be kept in a proper state of discipline
unless they are constantly busy. Chase had
his duties on deck to perform as well as his work
in the cabin; for when sail was made or shortened,
all hands and the cook were called upon to assist.
Then, too, the position he occupied was menial&mdash;he
was emphatically a servant of servants, as every
greenhorn is at sea. The men in the forecastle
called upon him to wait on them, and even the
other cabin-boy, who, although a year younger than
himself, had made one voyage in the ship, exercised
authority over him, and shifted upon his shoulders
the responsibility of keeping the captain’s boots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
well blacked. He had to wait at table, and
stand behind the captain’s chair while that gentleman
was eating his meals, just as one of his own
father’s negro servants had done during the days
of slavery.</p>

<p>All this was extremely galling to Chase, who was
a high-spirited, aristocratic young fellow; but he had
too much good sense to make his situation worse by
rebelling. He performed his duties carefully and
patiently, acting on a hint his sensible father had
once given him, and which he constantly bore in
mind. “Henry,” said Mr. Chase, on one occasion,
“if it is your fortune in life to be a bottle-cleaner,
see to it that you make the bottles <i>shine</i>.”</p>

<p>Chase made the plates and the knives and forks
shine, but he chafed inwardly while he was doing it,
and told himself over and over again that he could
not think of any combination of circumstances that
would ever induce him, of his own free will, to go
to sea as a foremast hand or a cabin-boy.</p>

<p>With some of his surroundings Chase was agreeably
surprised. While he was on board the Petrel&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
was the name of the ship&mdash;he did not hear
an oath uttered by either officers or men, or see a
blow struck. The captain was a man who did not
permit such things. In this respect Chase’s experience
was very different from that of another of his
friends, whose adventures in the forecastle we have
yet to relate.</p>

<p>During the voyage scarcely an incident happened
that was worthy of notice. The first port in which
the Petrel dropped her anchor was Callao, where
she remained nearly a month. The next was Honolulu,
in the Sandwich Islands. Here another long
and, to Chase, extremely vexatious delay occurred;
but the cargo was discharged at last, a new one
taken aboard, and the Petrel spread her wings for
California. Propelled by favoring breezes she made
a quick run, and finally the Golden Gate was passed,
and the anchor dropped in the harbor of San Francisco.
One of the boats was called away to take
the captain ashore, and just as it was ready to start,
Chase was summoned into the cabin and presented
with his discharge, and a five-dollar bill. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
money was a present from the captain, and was
something he did not expect. He had kept a strict
run of his accounts, and knew that the articles he
had drawn from the slop-chest footed up a dollar or
two more than his wages.</p>

<p>With a light heart Chase gathered up his clothes
and blankets, leaving his mattress, which was too
bulky to go in his bundle, as a gift to one of the
sailors, and taking his seat in the captain’s boat was
soon landed on the wharf. He was alone in a strange
city, with scarcely more than money enough in his
pocket to take him fairly out of its limits, and the
whole world was before him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="small">A CHEAP BOARDING-HOUSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Chase</span> had waited and longed for the hour of
his liberation, and now that it had arrived, he
did not enjoy it as he had thought he would. He
looked at the ship which had been his home for
so many long months, then at the captain, who had
won his heart by the kindness and consideration
with which he had always treated him, and had
half a mind to turn back and ask to be received
again as one of the crew. But there was that long
voyage that the Petrel had yet to make, and Chase
had grown heartily weary of the blue water and
hard ship’s fare. The vessel was going, in the first
place, back to the Sandwich Islands, then to China,
and home by the way of the Cape of Good Hope;
and no one on board of her knew just how long it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
would take to make the voyage. Before it was half
over, Chase hoped to be among friends once more.</p>

<p>With a long-drawn sigh the boy hurried away,
and so very much engrossed was he with his thoughts
that he missed seeing something that would have
astonished him beyond measure, and might have
been the means of saving him from many hardships
and privations that he afterward suffered. During
the time he had been on board the Petrel, Uncle
Dick Gaylord’s schooner had been launched, and
had made her voyage around the Horn to San
Francisco. She was now lying at her anchorage in
the harbor, and she attracted Chase’s attention,
just as she attracted the notice of everybody, sailor
or landsman, who passed that way. He did not
look at her, however, until after he had passed her
stern, on which were painted her name and the name
of the port to which she belonged&mdash;“Stranger:
Bellville.”</p>

<p>How Chase’s heart would have throbbed could he
have seen those two words! He knew nothing of
the extended tour his friends had undertaken, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the Club themselves had not known of it, until that
memorable Christmas morning when Uncle Dick
revealed to them the secret to which he had so often
alluded. Chase never dreamed that that little vessel
had brought Walter and the rest to that part of the
world, and that she was waiting there until they
should return from their trip over the mountains.
The man in blue, who was leaning over her rail,
looking at him as he passed, could have told him all
about it, if Chase had known enough to ask him;
but the boy only just glanced at him, ran his eye
over the schooner, said to himself that she was a
beautiful little craft, and undoubtedly a “trotter,”
and then throwing his bundle down beside a warehouse,
seated himself on it to think over his situation,
and decide upon his future movements; for,
as yet, he had not been able to make up his mind
what he ought to do, although he had been constantly
turning the matter over in his mind ever
since he learned that he was to be discharged at San
Francisco. He must make up his mind to something
before he wrote to his father, so that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
tell him just what he intended to do, and Mr. Chase
might know where to send assistance or meet him in
case of necessity. But the longer he pondered the
matter, the more undecided he became; and he
finally resolved to begin the letter, hoping that
before it was completed something would suggest
itself to him.</p>

<p>Having come to this determination, Chase shouldered
his bundle and hurried away again. He went
up one street and down another, and finally, as he
was passing along, glanced through an open door
into what proved to be the reading-room of a hotel.
There were several gentlemen in the room, some
absorbed in their papers, others engaged in writing,
and the long table was abundantly supplied with
pens, ink and note-paper. Here was as good a
place as he could find, Chase thought; so he entered
without ceremony, deposited his bundle in
one corner, and drew a chair up to the table. His
entrance attracted the attention of several gentlemen,
who looked at him in surprise, and one of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
after giving him a cold, impudent stare, got up and
moved farther away from him.</p>

<p>“Suit yourself, my dear fellow,” thought Chase.
“Your room is as good as your company. I wonder
if strangers are so unwelcome in this country that
you feel called upon to insult every one you meet!”</p>

<p>He drew a sheet of paper toward him, picked up
a pen and was about to dip it in the ink, when a
dapper little clerk, with his hair parted in the
middle, came up and slapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“There is a sailor’s boarding-house around the
corner, two streets below here,” said he, indicating
the direction with the little finger of his left hand,
which bore a large seal-ring.</p>

<p>“Is there?” said Chase. “Well, I am not looking
for a sailor’s boarding-house just now. I simply
wish to write a letter.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t do it here,” said the clerk,
taking the pen from the boy’s fingers. “None but
gentlemen stop here. This is a first-class hotel.”</p>

<p>“O, it is, is it?” exclaimed Chase, rising and
picking up his bundle. “Then I should think the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
proprietors would employ first-class people for their
servants.”</p>

<p>Almost too angry to speak plainly, Chase made
the best of his way to the street. This little incident
reminded him of something of which he had always
been aware, but which he had never expected to
have brought home to him in this way, that distinctions
exist on shore as well as on ship-board.
The clothing he wore was against him. That hotel
was for gentlemen only; and as a sailor is not
supposed to be a gentleman, he could not stop there
even long enough to write a letter to his father.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it serves me just right. I have been
too much in the habit of judging people by their
clothes, but I will never do it again,” thought Chase,
who now saw how unjust were the conclusions that
might be drawn by measuring men and boys by
such a standard. “I wonder if that clerk would
have any greater respect for me if he knew that my
father could buy him and his hotel! By the
way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here Chase stopped and looked down at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
ground a moment in a brown study, and then turned
and slowly retraced his steps. Might it not be a
good plan, after all, he asked himself, to take the
clerk’s advice and go to the sailor’s boarding-house?
It would be sheer folly for him to attempt the
journey across the plains without any money in his
pocket, and the best thing he could do would be to
procure a cheap boarding-place, and stay there until
he could receive assistance from home. He would
write for money at once, and while it was coming he
could find something to do that would bring him
enough to pay his board. This was the best idea
that had yet suggested itself to him, and Chase
resolved to act upon it.</p>

<p>“Around the corner, two streets below,” he
thought, recalling the clerk’s words, and glancing
in at the reading-room as he passed. “I’ll make
it my business to come back here in a few days&mdash;just
as soon as I can get some shore-clothes&mdash;and
I’ll see if that fellow will raise any objections to me
then.”</p>

<p>Chase easily found the house of which he was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
search, for its location was pointed out by a weather-beaten
sign, bearing a picture that might once have
represented a frigate under full sail; but he was not
very well pleased with it after he found it. It was
not as neat as he expected to see it. Like the sign
over the sidewalk, it was dingy and weather-stained,
and some of the frosted panes in the windows were
broken out, their places being supplied by rough
boards and thick brown wrapping-paper, which were
tacked over the holes. The house looked as though
it had passed through a battle, as indeed it had,
several of them; and if Chase had been there the
night before, he would have seen the police make a
raid upon it in force. While he stood undecided
whether to enter or look further for lodgings, the
door opened, and a rough-looking man in his shirt-sleeves
appeared on the threshold. He had seen
Chase through the window.</p>

<p>“Why, Jack, how de do?” he exclaimed, seizing
the boy’s hand and giving it a cordial grip and
shake. “When did your ship arrive? Step right
into the house. I was looking for you and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
were looking for me, I know. All the boys know
where to come to get plenty to eat and drink.”</p>

<p>Chase was surprised at this greeting. The man
acted and talked as if he had seen him before.
Without saying a word he allowed himself to be led
into the house, surrendered his bundle when the
landlord offered to take it from his hand, and seated
himself in a chair pointed out to him.</p>

<p>Before the man addressed him again, Chase had
a few moments’ leisure in which to take a rapid
survey of his surroundings. He saw enough in
that time to make him wish that he had never come
in there. The room was dirty in the extreme; the
walls and the ceiling, the former adorned with
cheap prints representing engagements at sea, were
of a dingy brown color&mdash;made so, no doubt, by
tobacco-smoke; the floor was covered with sawdust
and littered with cigar-stumps, and a man dressed
in the garb of a sailor was nodding in one corner.
One end of the room was occupied by a bar, behind
which the landlord was stowing away the
bundle Chase had given him. Having done this, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
placed a glass on the counter and gave the boy a
friendly wink, the meaning of which the latter
plainly understood.</p>

<p>“No, <i>sir</i>,” said he, emphatically.</p>

<p>“Temperance?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“The worst kind,” replied Chase.</p>

<p>“Stick to it. You’ll be a captain some day.”</p>

<p>“I think not,” returned the boy; “I have had
enough of sailoring already, and I’ll never put my
foot on a ship again as one of the crew. I will
carry a hod on shore first.”</p>

<p>“Ah! ran away from home, did you?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not. I shipped aboard the Petrel in
Cuba, supposing that she was bound for the States;
but she took me to the Sandwich Islands and then
brought me here. I want to go home by the easiest
and quickest route I can find, and I shall start as
soon as I receive money from my father.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t strapped, be you?”</p>

<p>“Not quite. I want to write a letter to my
father at once,” continued Chase. “I shall hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
from him in ten days or two weeks, and, in the
meantime, I want some cheap place to stay.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re in it now. You couldn’t find a
better place in Fr’isco. How much be you going to
ask your father for?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it will take considerable money to buy
me some shore-clothes and pay my railroad, stage and
steamboat fare all the way home,” said Chase, rather
surprised at the question&mdash;“two hundred dollars,
perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Every cent of it, and more,” said the man,
slapping his hand on the counter. “Travelling is
high, I can tell you. Is the old man rich?”</p>

<p>“He’s got some money,” answered Chase, who
wondered how the man could tell that it would take
more than two hundred dollars to pay his fare home
when he did not know where he lived.</p>

<p>“Then ask him for three hundred. You’ll need
it all, and you can stay here till it comes. I won’t
charge you a cent, either. But, I say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here the man came out from behind the counter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
drew a chair up by Chase’s side, and slapping him
on the knee, said, in a confidential tone:</p>

<p>“I say, you’d best leave the money you’ve got
in my hands, as a sort of security, you know. I’ll
take care of it for you. There’s some pretty rough
fellows comes around here sometimes, and they
wouldn’t mind taking it away from you, if they
knew you had it. Eh?”</p>

<p>“How much do you charge a day for boarding
and lodging?”</p>

<p>“A dollar.”</p>

<p>“If I pay you every day as long as I stay here,
won’t that satisfy you?”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t. You see, if there’s any robbing
and stealing done, I shall be blamed for it, because
I’m sorter responsible for you while you are here.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be. I can take care of myself.
Besides, I may conclude not to stay with you, you
know. I shall probably find some place I like better,”
said the boy, glancing about the room.</p>

<p>“O, you’ll stay, I’ll bet you on that,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
landlord, with a laugh and a look that Chase did
not like.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will compel me to stay against
my will,” said the boy, rising to his feet. “I have
no desire to stop in a house frequented by men who
do ‘robbing and stealing.’ I think I can find more
agreeable quarters. At any rate, I will look around
a little before I decide. I’ll trouble you for my
bundle.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll trouble you to sit down,” said the
man, pushing him back into his chair. “You needn’t
think you’re going to go out on the street to carry
tales to the police about my house.”</p>

<p>“I have no intention of doing anything of the
kind, for I don’t know anything about your hotel,
and I don’t want to,” said Chase, trying hard to
keep up a bold front, although his heart sank within
him.</p>

<p>The boy had been in the house scarcely ten minutes,
and he began to see that he had got himself
into trouble by coming there. He was in one of
those low sailor boarding-houses of which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
heard and read so much, kept by a man known as a
“landshark,” who, while he pretended to make a
business of feeding and sheltering seafaring men,
gained the principal part of his living by robbing
them. Those who came into his house with full
pockets, never took a cent out with them. Probably
his cupidity had been excited by the mention of the
large amount that Chase expected his father to send
him immediately upon the receipt of his letter. If
he could keep the boy there until the money arrived,
Chase would never see a cent of it. He would
retain it all himself, and wind up the business by
shipping his lodger off on some vessel, pocketing his
advance, which would amount to twenty or fifty
dollars more, according to the length of the voyage
for which he was shipped. Chase had heard much
of landsharks from the sailors on board the Petrel,
and he understood the situation perfectly, but he
was at a loss how to get out of it. It would be folly
to irritate the man, so he tried to appease him.</p>

<p>“There’s no use in getting angry over it,” said
he. “What do you want me to do?”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>“I want you to hand out your money, and let me
take care of it for you,” said the landlord.</p>

<p>“There it is,” said Chase, producing the five-dollar
bill.</p>

<p>“This ain’t no account. We use gold in this
country. Where’s the rest? Better let me have
it all, because I’m responsible, you know.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it all now. I haven’t another
cent.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better sound me,” said Chase.
“My wages amounted to only seventy-five dollars,
and the articles I drew from the slop-chest used
them all up.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a nice lad to come ashore after a
long voyage, ain’t you now?” said the landlord,
who did not try to conceal his disgust.</p>

<p>“I am not worth robbing, am I?” said Chase, to
himself.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re a deserter,” continued the
landlord, “else you’d have more money.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t very well have deserted in broad daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
with a bundle over my shoulder,” said Chase.
“And besides, there’s my certificate of discharge.”</p>

<p>“That may be all right, and then again it may
not,” said the landlord, holding the document upside
down while he looked at it. “There’s a law that
governs us boarding-house keepers, and you must
stay here till I find out whether or not you are all
right.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” replied the boy, who knew that he
could not help himself. “Send somebody down to
the Petrel with that discharge, and if Captain Pratt
doesn’t say it is correct, I am willing to go back.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’ll put you in jail. That’s what
they do with deserters sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk it. Now, if you will furnish me with
writing materials, I’ll write that letter. The sooner
that money gets here, the better it will suit me.”</p>

<p>“Will the old man be sure and send it?”</p>

<p>“Of course he will.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anybody here in Fr’isco?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better tell him to send the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
to me&mdash;John McKay is my name&mdash;because you
can’t get it, being a stranger. You’ll need somebody
to prove who you be.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you do that?”</p>

<p>“Well, no; I couldn’t. I don’t know you from
a side of sole leather. I never seen you before.
If it is sent to me I can get it easy enough, no
matter whether it comes by check or express.”</p>

<p>“And then you can hand it over to me?”</p>

<p>“Of course, and I will, too&mdash;every cent. I’m
honest.”</p>

<p>“O, I don’t doubt it,” said Chase. “You look
honest.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go and get the pen, ink and paper
for you, and then I’ll show you to a room up-stairs,
where you’ll be quiet and peaceable like, and there
won’t be nobody to bother you.”</p>

<p>“I can write the letter down here just as well,”
said Chase, who was afraid that if he went up-stairs
he might not be allowed to come down again very
soon, “and then I can take it to the post-office myself.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>“But I don’t want you to write it down here,
because there’s always fellows coming in. When
you get it writ, I can send it to the office for you.
Don’t forget my name&mdash;John McKay.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” said Chase, rising to his feet. He
executed this movement with the determination of
making a bold strike for his freedom. The landlord
was moving toward the counter, and Chase
stood ready for a spring, intending, as soon as he
went behind it, to dart for the door and run out
into the street. But the man acted as if he suspected
his design, for he walked straight to the
door, locked it and put the key into his pocket.</p>

<p>“That’s just to keep everybody out till I come
back,” said he, by way of explanation.</p>

<p>The landlord then went behind his counter, and
after overhauling the contents of a drawer, found the
writing materials and a stamped envelope. Nodding
to Chase to follow, he led the way out of the barroom,
up two flights of uncarpeted stairs, along a
narrow, winding hall, and finally opened a door
which led into a room so dark that Chase could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
see a single thing in it. There were windows in it,
however, for little streaks of light came in through
what appeared to be closed blinds.</p>

<p>“Can’t you give me a better room than this?”
asked Chase, with an involuntary shudder. “I
can’t see to write in here.”</p>

<p>“You can after a while,” said the landlord. “It
ain’t so dark as it looks at first sight. Now, how
long before I shall come back?”</p>

<p>“O, give me an hour. I’ve got a good deal to
say, and besides it takes me a long time to write a
letter.”</p>

<p>The man deposited the writing materials on a
rough table in one corner of the room, and then
went out, closing the door after him, and turning a
key in the lock as he did so. Chase heard it and
knew that he was a prisoner.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="small">BROWN’S MISFORTUNE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Chase</span> realized his situation, but he was not
as badly frightened as he would have been a
few months before. One soon learns to bear up
bravely under almost any adverse circumstances,
especially if he have an object in view. Chase had
an object to accomplish, and that was to reach home
and friends once more. He could do nothing
toward it while he was locked up there, so he at
once began an examination of his prison with a view
to escaping from it. He waited until the landlord
had descended the stairs, and then, after listening a
few minutes at the door, to make sure that he did
not come back, turned his attention to the nearest
window. He found there only the shattered remains
of a sash, and what he had supposed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
blinds were rough boards nailed on the outside.
These boards were further secured by two bars of
iron, one at the top and the other at the bottom.
They had been forced out a little at the bottom, as
far as the bar would allow them to go, and there
were deep dents and scratches on them, showing
that a lever of some kind had been used against
them.</p>

<p>“This room is a regular jail,” thought Chase.
“That landlord takes in all the sailors that come
here, and after they have spent every cent of their
money, he locks them up here until he gets ready
to ship them off on some vessel. That’s what he
intends to do with me, and he seems in a fair way
to accomplish his object.”</p>

<p>Talking thus to himself, Chase made a close examination
of the fastenings of the window. Some
one who had been confined in that room had made
a desperate effort to push off the boards, that was
evident, for the marks of the lever he had used
were there yet. But before the boards could be
pushed out far enough to draw the nails, they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
been stopped by the bar outside. The first thing
was to get at these nails and break them off. The
bottom of one of the boards could then be pushed
aside, leaving an opening through which he could
crawl out.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_246.jpg" alt="Escaped" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small smcap">Chase’s Escape from the Sailor Boarding House.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Chase thought a moment, and then pulling out
his knife, which fortunately contained a large,
strong blade, set to work to cut through the soft
wood of the window-sill, down to one of the nails
which held the outside board. This he did in a
very few minutes. Then he placed the point of his
knife under the nail, and prying it up until he could
take hold of it with his fingers, bent it back and
forth until he broke it off. Three others were
served in the same way, and then Chase pushed the
lower end of the board aside and looked out.
The roof of the adjoining house was six or eight
feet lower than the window. It was flat, and there
was a woman upon it engaged in hanging out
clothes. She hung up the last article while Chase
was looking at her, and picking up her empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
basket disappeared through a scuttle which she left
open behind her.</p>

<p>“I don’t much like the situation,” said the boy,
wiping the big drops of perspiration from his face.
“My only way of escape is through that house.
Suppose that scuttle leads into the living-room of
some family, and I should find a big fellow there
who would want to know my business?”</p>

<p>Chase did not stop to answer this question, being
resolved to trust to luck. He was working his way
through the window while he was talking to himself,
and hanging by his hands dropped down upon the
roof. He ran at once to the scuttle, and upon looking
into it, saw that it led into a hall which did not
seem to be occupied. Without hesitation he descended
the ladder, hurried down the flight of steps
he found at the end of the hall, and in a moment
more was safe in the street.</p>

<p>The very first man he saw when he got there was
the landlord, John McKay, who stood in the open
door of his boarding-house, no doubt looking out
for an opportunity to take in some other unwary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
sailor who had just landed from a long voyage.
If the boy’s sudden appearance caused him any
surprise, he did not show it. He made no move,
and neither did he say anything. Chase walked
away, looking back now and then to make sure that
the landlord did not follow him, and at the first
corner he found a policeman, to whom he hurriedly
related all that had passed since his arrival at the
boarding-house. The officer did not act as though
he heard a word of the story. He kept looking up
and down the street, and when the boy ceased
speaking walked slowly toward the boarding-house,
Chase following. The landlord saw them coming,
but, somewhat to Chase’s surprise, exhibited no
signs of alarm. He kept his place in the doorway,
and when the two came up, said, familiarly:</p>

<p>“Hallo, Jenkins!”</p>

<p>“How are you, Mack?” said the officer. “This
boy says you’ve got a bundle of his.”</p>

<p>“Well, that isn’t the only lie he’s told since I
first seen him,” returned the landlord. “He came
to my house about two weeks ago, without clothes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
money, and I’ve been boarding him free gratis ever
since.”</p>

<p>“Why, I came to your house not more than an
hour ago, and you took my bundle away from me
and robbed me of five dollars besides,” said Chase,
greatly amazed at the man’s impudence.</p>

<p>“Do you hear that, Jim?” said the landlord,
turning partly around and addressing some one in
the house.</p>

<p>“I do,” replied a voice; and a burly fellow,
whom Chase had not before seen about the premises,
came out from behind the bar and approached the
door. “That’s the return you always get for doing
a sailor-man a kindness. I can show on the books
that he owes for two weeks’ board and lodging.”</p>

<p>“I guess you had better move on,” said the
officer, turning to Chase.</p>

<p>“And leave my clothes and money? I guess
not. They’re mine and I want them. I make a
complaint against this man, and it is your business
to arrest him.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p>“Go on without another word,” said the policeman,
“or I’ll make it my business to run you in.”</p>

<p>Chase was not a city boy, but he knew what the
officer meant. Filled with surprise and bewilderment,
he turned about and made his way around a
corner, out of sight. When he reached the next
street he looked back, and saw that the policeman
was standing on the corner watching him.</p>

<p>“Now I am beaten,” thought Chase, turning
down the first street he came to, in order to leave
the hated officer out of sight. “A landshark robs
me in broad daylight, and a policeman upholds him
in it, and threatens to arrest me if I say another
word! I wonder if that is what city folks call
justice!”</p>

<p>Chase lost heart now, for the only time since his
first night on board the Petrel. With no clothing
or money, alone in a strange city, where the officers
appeared to be in league with the rascals, and an
honest boy was followed and watched as if he were
a suspicious character, it was no wonder that he felt
afraid and dispirited. He did not dare remain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
San Francisco now, for if, while in search of employment,
he should chance to wander back on policeman
Jenkins’s beat, that officer might arrest him and
have him locked up as a vagrant. The bare thought
was horrifying to Chase, who hurried along as if he
hoped to get away from it, turning down every corner
he came to, until at last he found himself near
the wharf again. Here he was accosted by a stalwart
young fellow with a pack on his back, who
hurriedly asked if a boat, which was lying close by
with steam up, was the one that carried passengers
from Fr’isco to Vallejo.</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know,” answered Chase. “I
am a stranger here. Where is Vallejo?”</p>

<p>“It is on the other side of the bay,” replied the
man. “It is the place where they go to take the
cars for the States.”</p>

<p>“Then I should like to go there,” said Chase,
eagerly. “I am bound for the States.”</p>

<p>“So am I, if I can ever get there. I came out here
three years ago to dig gold, and I had more money
when I first got here than I have ever had since.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
I shall never be able to scrape enough together to
pay my fare to Indiana, so I am going to work my
way back. They want hands on the railroad up
here at Independence. They are paying three dollars
a day.”</p>

<p>“Now, I should like a chance like that,” said
Chase. “Where is Independence?”</p>

<p>“Up the road a piece.”</p>

<p>“How is one to get there?”</p>

<p>“That’s the question. If we were only at
Vallejo, we could walk up the railroad; but there
are twenty-five miles of water between us and that
place.”</p>

<p>“Well, won’t the railroad company furnish transportation
to those who want to work for them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Suppose we go back and look.”</p>

<p>Chase did not know what the man meant by
going back and looking, but he followed him without
asking any questions, and presently found
himself in front of a large placard posted on a billboard
and headed&mdash;</p>

<p>
“<i>500 More Men Wanted to Work on the Central<br />
Pacific Railroad.</i>”<br />
</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p>It was this notice that had first put it into the
head of Chase’s new acquaintance to work his way
back to his home in Indiana; and near the bottom
was something that had escaped his eye:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>For further particulars and transportation,
apply at the Company’s Office, No. <a href="#Page_54">54</a> K street,
Sacramento.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>“Humph! we are no better off now than we
were before,” said Chase, who remembered enough
of his geography to know that Sacramento was
some distance from San Francisco. “How are we
ever going to get to the company’s office.”</p>

<p>“Go right aboard that steamer you see up there,”
said a man, who was standing near enough to them
to overhear their conversation. “She goes to Vallejo,
and from there you can take the train to Sacramento.”</p>

<p>“Without a cent in our pockets?” asked Chase’s
companion.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you will contract to work on the railroad
for one month.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>I</i> will, and be glad of the chance,” said Chase.
“We are obliged to you for the information.”</p>

<p>Chase and his friend hurried back to the steamer,
and going on board seated themselves near a group
of men who were congregated on the lower deck.
They were rough-looking fellows, of all nationalities,
and as many of them were talking earnestly in their
own tongue&mdash;although nobody appeared to be listening
to them&mdash;the hubbub that arose made Chase
wonder. Like himself, they were bound for the
company’s office; and he shovelled dirt and blasted
rocks in company with some of them for many
a day afterward.</p>

<p>During the run up the bay Chase told his new
friend, who said his name was George Brown, something
of his history, and in return Brown gave him
a sketch of his own life. It did not take him long
to do it, for he had nothing interesting or exciting
to tell. He had left a comfortable home in the
States, hoping to acquire a fortune in a few days in
California. He had gone first to the mines, and,
although he had seen men take gold in paying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
quantities from holes almost by the side of the one
in which he was working, he had not been able to
earn enough to pay for his provisions. He had
finally become a teamster, and on more than one
occasion had been glad to saw wood for his breakfast.
He was bound to get home now in some way,
and when he once got there he would stay. If he
had worked half as hard on his farm as he had
worked in California for the last three years, he
would have had money in the bank.</p>

<p>The trip up the bay would, no doubt, have been
a pleasant one to Chase had he been in a frame of
mind to enjoy it. But he was thinking of his home
off in Louisiana, and of his friends, who now seemed
farther away from him than ever before. If this
man, who was accustomed to work and to “roughing
it,” had been three years trying to get back to
his home, how long at that rate would it take <i>him</i>,
Chase asked himself.</p>

<p>When the steamer reached Vallejo he followed
the others to the train, and was packed away in a
box-car for Sacramento. At the company’s office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
he went through certain forms of agreement, which
he could not have repeated when he came out if he
had tried, and was then ordered into another box-car
that was to take him to Independence. He
travelled night and day, and, although he had no
bed to sleep on, he had plenty to eat, and kept up
his spirits by telling himself over and over again
that every turn of the wheels brought him nearer
to his home.</p>

<p>Arriving at Independence, he was put to work at
once, and during the next month led a life of toil
and hardship to which his experience on board the
Petrel was mere boy’s play. The first thing he
did when he had a few minutes’ leisure, was to hunt
up the superintendent, or the “boss,” as the men
called him, to whom he stated his troubles, and of
whom he begged a stamped envelope, and a sheet
of paper, and borrowed a lead-pencil. With these
he wrote a long letter to his father, telling what he
had done since leaving Bellville and what he intended
to do, not forgetting to mention the amount
which he thought would be necessary to take him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
home; and having given the letter into the hands
of the superintendent, who promised to see that it
was duly sent off, he went to work with a lighter
heart than he had carried for many a day, believing
that by the time his month had expired, the assistance
he so much needed would be at hand.</p>

<p>“And when it does come, Brown,” said Chase,
who had learned to look upon his new acquaintance
with almost a brother’s affection, “you shall not be
left out in the cold. If it hadn’t been for you I
wouldn’t be here now, and I’ll see you through as
far as my money will take us.”</p>

<p>It was well for the boy’s peace of mind that he
did not know what became of that letter. The superintendent
put it carefully away in his pocket, and
took it out again&mdash;nearly eight weeks afterward,
when the one who wrote it was hopelessly lost in the
mountains near Fort Bolton.</p>

<p>Although Chase expected a happy deliverance out
of all his troubles without any effort on his part
to bring it about, neither he nor Brown neglected
to post himself in everything that it might be necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
for them to know, in case they should be compelled
to continue their journey without money to
pay their fare on the stages. Among other things,
they learned that the Union Pacific, which was
slowly advancing to meet the road on which they
were at work, had progressed beyond Cheyenne, and
that between that point and Independence there
were several trails and stage-routes, some longer and
some shorter, but any one of which would lead them
in the direction they wished to go. Their fellow-workmen
assured them that it would not be much
of a tramp across the country for a couple of healthy
youngsters, and if at any time they got out of food,
the first man they met would be willing to supply
them, no matter whether they had money or not.</p>

<p>The month for which Chase and his friend had
contracted wore slowly away, but the expected letter
from Bellville did not arrive. Chase grew more and
more impatient and anxious as the days passed, and
when he was paid off at the end of the month, he
would have been glad to renew his contract, but
Brown would not listen. “Let’s put out and go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
work when we reach the other road,” said he.
“You can write to your father just as well from
Cheyenne as you can from here. Your letter must
have miscarried.”</p>

<p>Brown emphasized his advice by declaring that
he was going whether Chase did or not. Cold
weather was coming on, he said; the snow had fallen,
during the previous winter, sixty feet deep over
seven miles of the road-bed on which the rails had
since been laid, and he did not like the idea of being
shut out from home by any such barrier as that.
He was bound to get through to the other side of
the mountains before winter set in, come what might.
So Chase reluctantly made up the small bundle of
clothing and bedding he had purchased from the
stores, put carefully away the slender stock of money
that he had remaining after paying his board-bill
and other debts he had contracted, and followed
Brown, who stepped off with a light heart. The
latter’s face was turned toward home once more,
and that was enough to put him in the best of
spirits.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>“If we were in the settlements now,” said he,
making an effort to bring Chase’s usual smile back
to his face, “the folks would say of us: ‘Look at
those two tramps; lock the dog in the hen-house.’
But out here, where there are better fellows than
ourselves as poor as we, we are ‘emigrants,’ and
people don’t think it necessary to watch us, lest we
should steal everything they’ve got.”</p>

<p>Keeping up a fire of small-talk, Brown enlivened
many a mile of their first day’s journey, and finally
succeeded in making his companion take a brighter
view of their prospects. They made about twenty
miles by dark, and then built a fire beside the road
and went into camp.</p>

<p>Chase awoke once during the night and saw
Brown sitting by the fire, engaged in tying his
money up in his handkerchief. He simply noted
the fact, and would never have thought of it again,
had it not been brought to his mind by an incident
that happened the next day. They were walking
along toward the close of the afternoon, when Brown,
who had kept up a constant singing and story-telling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
suddenly paused and put his hand into his pocket.
He opened his eyes, felt in his other pocket, then
threw down his bundle and began a thorough examination
of his clothing.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Chase.</p>

<p>“Matter enough,” replied his companion, glancing
back along the road. “I’ve lost my money.”</p>




<hr />

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="small">WHAT CAME OF IT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">“Yes</span>, sir, I have lost my money,” repeated
Brown, pulling out each of his pockets in succession,
to show that they were all empty. “I
haven’t got a red cent.”</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t in your pocket,” said Chase, as
soon as he had recovered from his surprise.</p>

<p>“Eh?” exclaimed Brown, his face assuming a
genuine look of astonishment now. “How do you
know it wasn’t?”</p>

<p>“Because I saw you sitting by the fire last night,
tying your money up in your handkerchief,” replied
Chase.</p>

<p>“Ah! I&mdash;eh? Yes; certainly you did, and
that very move was what has ruined me. Money,
handkerchief and all are gone.”</p>

<p>Chase looked sharply at his companion. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
was something about the business that did not look
just right. Brown didn’t act sorry enough.</p>

<p>“I say it is gone,” said the latter, as if Chase
had disputed the point. “What is to be done
now? You’ll have to support us both, Hank.”</p>

<p>“But fifteen dollars will not buy us food until we
reach Cheyenne,” replied Chase.</p>

<p>“I know it; but it will have to last us as long
as we can make it, and then we must go to work.
If we can find nothing to do, the only thing left
for us is to separate and let each fellow take care
of himself.”</p>

<p>Again Chase looked closely at his friend. This
was a new doctrine for the latter to advocate. Heretofore,
especially since he learned that Chase expected
assistance from home, Brown had laid great
stress on the fact that they were to remain together
until they reached the States, no matter what might
happen; and if good fortune befell either of them,
the other was to share it. Chase had been glad to
agree to it. As matters stood when they left Independence,
Brown had the advantage, for not having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
been obliged to purchase any clothes or bedding, he
had been able to save every cent of his month’s
wages, except what he had expended for food. If
the superintendent had mailed that letter, then
Chase would have carried the heavier purse, and he
never would have thought of deserting his companion.</p>

<p>“I never saw the like of this,” said Brown,
looking down at the ground and shaking his head.</p>

<p>“We’ll not give it up without trying to find it,”
said Chase. “Let’s go back.”</p>

<p>With a great show of eagerness Brown caught up
his bundle and hurried down the road, followed by
Chase, who, however, did not make any effort to find
the money. He had found it already. He could
have put his hand upon it without stepping out of
his tracks. The moment Brown turned his back to
him, he saw something sticking out from under the
collar of his shirt. It was the corner of a blue
cotton handkerchief&mdash;the same one in which Chase
had seen him tying up his money the night before.
The gold was slung around Brown’s neck, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
his shirt. Of that much Chase was certain; but he
was not quite so certain that he understood the motive
the man had in view in hiding it.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is any need of going farther
back,” said Brown, pausing and looking dejectedly
at Chase, after they had retraced their steps for a
short distance up the road; “do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” answered the boy. “We have
travelled fast to-day, and it is a long way back to
the place where we camped last night. You had
the money then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I haven’t seen it since. Some fellow
has got it safe enough before this time.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Chase.</p>

<p>With one accord the two turned about and resumed
their journey. Chase wanted to think, but
Brown was anxious to talk.</p>

<p>“What do you say to my proposition, Hank?”
said he. “I don’t like to leave you, but if we can’t
get work together, ought not each one to look out
for himself?”</p>

<p>“Of course he ought.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>“But you won’t leave me in the lurch?” continued
Brown. “You won’t go back on me because
I have no money?”</p>

<p>“I have just as much intention of deserting you
as you have of serving me that way,” replied Chase,
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Give me your hand on that, my boy,” said
Brown. “I knew you were true blue, or I
shouldn’t have stuck to you as long as I have.”</p>

<p>Brown, having, as he imagined, extorted a promise
from his companion that he would remain with
him as long as his money held out, relapsed into
silence, and the boy was allowed leisure to follow
out some plans that had suggested themselves to
him. In the first place, he wanted to make sure
that he was not mistaken in regard to the money;
so he watched his opportunity, and presently he
and Brown bumped their shoulders together with
some violence, as people will sometimes do who walk
together without keeping step. The result was positive
proof that Brown had not lost his money, for
Chase heard the gold pieces jingle as plainly as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
could hear the sound of his own footsteps. Brown
heard it, too, and glanced quickly into Chase’s
face; but seeing nothing there to excite his suspicions,
he said nothing, but simply moved farther
away so that the experiment could not be repeated.</p>

<p>“The money is tied up in his handkerchief, just
as I supposed it was,” soliloquized Chase. “I think
I begin to see into the matter a little. We have
just fifty-five dollars between us&mdash;I have fifteen and
he owns the balance,&mdash;and that must last us during
a tramp of nearly four hundred miles. He thinks
that forty dollars will furnish food for one man
longer than fifty-five will for two. He intends to
live off my money without touching his own, and
when I am strapped, he is going to run away from
me; and he’ll have his forty dollars left to support
him during the rest of his journey. It is enough
for one, but I am a good deal of his opinion that it
is not enough for two. Now, fifteen dollars will
keep me alone in food longer than it will both of us,
so if you please, Mr. Brown, <i>I’ll</i> do the running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
away myself. If I must travel on my own hook, I’ll
do it while I have money in my pocket.”</p>

<p>Chase had hit the nail squarely on the head. He
had told Brown’s plans in detail as well as Brown
could have told them himself. The truth of the
matter was, that the man was too homesick to be
either honest or truthful. He was determined to
work his way back to Indiana by some means, no
matter who might suffer by it.</p>

<p>“I have half a mind to tell him that I know
what he is about,” thought Chase. “The coward,
to want to desert me when I offered to give him
half the money I expected to receive from father!
I say, Brown!”</p>

<p>When the boy had said this much, prudence
stepped in, and he paused. If he excited Brown’s
anger, the latter might take his money away from
him by force, and then he would be in a predicament
indeed.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” asked Brown. “Bad business,
ain’t it?”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” replied Chase. “How long do you
suppose my fifteen dollars will last us?”</p>

<p>“We must make it hold out as long as we possibly
can, even if we eat but one full meal a day.
But there is no use in looking so down-hearted over
it. We’ll work through somehow.”</p>

<p>Brown broke out into a song, to show how lightly
the matter sat on his own mind, and Chase once
more went off into a reverie. During the rest of
the day he had little to say, and when night came
he made preparations to slip away from his companion;
but no opportunity offered itself. Did
Brown suspect his designs? He certainly acted as
if he did, for he kept a sharp eye on Chase all the
time. If the latter moved during the night, Brown
turned over and looked at him.</p>

<p>For the three following days and nights Chase
lived under a sort of surveillance that was galling
to him, and during that time the provisions they
had brought with them from Independence were
exhausted, and two of Chase’s fifteen dollars were
spent at Salt Lake City, to replenish their store.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
On the fourth night they encamped near a party of
teamsters. Brown being weary with the day’s
journey remained at the fire, while Chase started
out to pay a visit to their neighbors. They were
glad to see him, offered him some of their supper,
and, of course, wanted to know where he was going
and what he intended to do when he got there.
Chase answered all their questions, and in accordance
with his usual custom, made inquiries concerning
the route to Cheyenne. The teamsters being
perfectly familiar with the road gave him all the
information he asked, and then one of them said:</p>

<p>“If you only knew it, you are going miles out
of your way by going to Cheyenne. Why don’t
you take the other trail?”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Chase.</p>

<p>“About a quarter of a mile below here. It is
the first road that turns to your right. You can’t
miss it, for there is a big dead oak hanging over it.
You’ll save at least a hundred miles of hard walking
by taking that route, and you’ll strike the
prairie either at Bolton or Reynolds. When you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
get there, you will be just as near the States as you
will be at Cheyenne.”</p>

<p>“Any chance of losing my way?”</p>

<p>“Not if you keep your eyes open and use your
tongue.”</p>

<p>“What can I find to eat?”</p>

<p>“Just as much as you can by this route. You’ll
meet a team or a train every day.”</p>

<p>“Any grizzly bears or other ferocious animals on
the way?”</p>

<p>“No more than there are on this. There’s plenty
of grouse, and if you get hard up for grub, you can
snare and cook enough in a day to last you a
week. I was lost down in there once, years ago,
when the trail wasn’t as well travelled as it is now,
and, although I had nothing but a pocket-knife with
me, I lived on the fat of the land and had a good
time besides.”</p>

<p>The teamster then went on to relate the particulars
of his adventure, which did not have much interest
for Chase, for he was thinking of something
else. When the story was finished, he bade his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
entertainers good-night, and slowly returned to his
own camp. Now was the time, he told himself, to
put his plans into execution. A lonely journey
through the mountains was not a pleasant thing to
look forward to, but it was better than remaining in
company with a man who intended to live off him
as long as his money held out, and then desert him.
He would take his bundle and start off on his own
hook that very night.</p>

<p>Having come to this determination, Chase made
the best of his way back to his camp, walking with
noiseless footsteps, so as not to disturb Brown, who,
he supposed, must be asleep by this time. But
his precaution proved to be useless, for Brown was
wide awake and waiting for him. “I thought you
were never coming back,” said he, with some impatience.</p>

<p>“Those fellows down there had some very interesting
stories to tell,” replied Chase. “Say,
Brown, would you sell your pack for ten dollars, if
you were me?”</p>

<p>“Ten dollars!” exclaimed Brown, raising himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
on his elbow, “I guess I would. That would
buy lots of bacon and biscuit.”</p>

<p>“I could use one of your blankets at night,
couldn’t I?” added Chase.</p>

<p>“Of course you can, as long as we remain
together.”</p>

<p>“Then that settles it.”</p>

<p>As Chase said this, he caught up his bundle and
hurried down the road again, while Brown lay back
in his blanket to await his return, laughing to himself
when he thought how nicely he was taking
care of himself at the expense of his confiding
friend. He waited an hour, but Chase did not
return; still another, and then he got up and walked
down the road. When he came within sight of the
camp of the teamsters he saw that the fire was burning
brightly, but the men themselves were wrapped
up in their blankets, sleeping soundly. Nothing
more being needed to convince him that a very neat
trick had been played upon him, Brown turned and
walked back to his own fire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Chase was hurrying along the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
trail to which the teamster had directed him. He
had no difficulty in finding it, for the dead oak tree
pointed out its location. It was very dark and
gloomy in there, for the mountains on both sides
were thickly covered with trees, and the rays of the
moon could scarcely penetrate through the dense
shade which they threw over the road. The road
itself, however, showed very plainly through the
darkness, and Chase had no difficulty in following
it. He travelled with all the speed of which he was
capable until too tired to go farther; and then
building a fire beside the road, he lay down near it
and slept until morning.</p>

<p>Ere many days had passed away Chase found that
he could get on just as well without Brown as he had
done with him. He met any number of teamsters
and emigrants, who willingly answered his questions
concerning the route before him, and if he happened
on a camp during the dinner or supper hour, he was
cordially invited to “stop and take a bite.” Of
course he was always obliged to tell his story to those
whose hospitality he shared, and when he departed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
he was invariably provided with all the cooked provisions
he was willing to carry in addition to his
bundle, and they never cost him a cent. At that
rate his thirteen dollars would last him until he
reached home. Of course, too, the journey grew
more and more monotonous and wearisome as the
days passed, and, worse than all, the thick, strong
shoes he had purchased before leaving Independence,
began to show signs of wear. But just as they were
ready to drop to pieces, he met a kind-hearted emigrant,
who gave him a pair of old boots, which,
although much too large for him, served to keep his
feet off the hard, rocky road. It was getting colder,
too, every day; the leaves were falling from the trees,
the wind whistled dismally through the gorges, the
teams and wagon-trains were not as often met as at
first, and everything told Chase that winter was fast
approaching. “You’d better toddle along right
peert,” said one of the teamsters to him. “Bolton,
which is the nighest station, is two hundred and
fifty miles away yet, and we’re going to ketch it in
a few days. When she does come she’ll be a snorter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
You’ve got a good stretch of prairie to cross after
you leave the foot-hills, and you don’t want to get
ketched out there in a snow-storm. Look out for
that.”</p>

<p>Chase gave heed to the friendly warning, and
made headway as rapidly as possible. “Two
hundred and fifty miles,” he kept saying to himself.
His journey was not half completed, and it seemed
to him that he had been an age on the road. Would
he ever reach Bolton? Sometimes he was almost
ready to give up trying, and lie down in the road
and wait until the snows of winter came and covered
him up. Then recollections of home and friends
would come thronging upon him, and he would press
forward with renewed energy, in spite of blistered
feet and weary, aching limbs, which sometimes almost
refused to sustain him. He was up before the sun,
and continued his journey until long after dark.
His situation at best was bad enough, but one night
he met with an adventure that made it infinitely
worse.</p>

<p>As he was hurrying along after dark, he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
suddenly upon a camp-fire. He was glad to see it,
for he had not met a human being for the last three
days, and the provisions that had been furnished him
by the last teamster were all exhausted. He hoped
to procure a fresh supply at this camp. If he could
not, he would be obliged to spend a day or two in
trapping grouse; and he was so very much afraid
of the snow-storm which had been so often predicted,
that he did not dare to waste a single hour. Furthermore,
the road of late had been growing very rough
and rocky, and he could no longer see the prints of
wagon-wheels. He began to fear that while travelling
in the dark, he had lost his way. Perhaps these
people could set him right. He walked boldly up
to the fire and greeted the men sitting there&mdash;two
rough-looking fellows, whom he at once put down as
hunters.</p>

<p>“Good evening, strangers,” said he.</p>

<p>“Wal, what do you want?” growled one of the
men, after they had both given him a good looking
over.</p>

<p>“Will you give me some supper and permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
to sleep by your fire?” asked Chase, rather doubtfully.
This was the first time during his fifteen
days in the mountains that any one had spoken to
him so roughly.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon we’ve got any more grub nor
we want ourselves,” was the surly response.</p>

<p>“O, I don’t ask you to give it to me,” said
Chase. “I am able and willing to pay for it.”</p>

<p>“You got any shiners?” asked the hunter, running
his eyes over the boy’s clothes.</p>

<p>“I know I don’t look like it, but I can prove my
words. See there,” said Chase, putting his hand
into his pocket and drawing out several gold and
silver pieces.</p>

<p>“How many of them you got?”</p>

<p>“Thirteen dollars’ worth. Can you give me
something to eat now?”</p>

<p>“I reckon we mought,” said the man, pointing
to a haunch of venison that hung upon a tree close
by.</p>

<p>Having become accustomed to the ways of the
world, Chase understood the invitation thus given.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
He took down the joint, cut off a couple of generous
slices with his knife, and holding them over the
flames with two sticks, looked about him with some
satisfaction. His supper was secure; he had a warm
fire to sleep by, and that was something on which
to congratulate himself.</p>

<p>The men were hunters or trappers, sure enough,
Chase told himself, and as they were the first of
their calling he had ever seen, he looked at them
with as much curiosity as the Sportsman’s Club had
looked at Parks and Reed, when those worthies first
came into their camp. They wore buckskin coats
and moccasins, were armed with rifles, and there
were two bundles of furs, principally otter and
beaver-skins, near the fire. They had no blankets,
but each had a saddle for a pillow, and their horses
were picketed on the other side of the road. In
answer to an inquiry from Chase, they told him,
rather gruffly, that they had been hunting in the
mountains, and were on their way to some fort to
dispose of their plunder. They did not seem inclined
to talk. They smoked their pipes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
watched the boy while he ate his supper, growled
out a reply in the affirmative when he asked if he
was on the road to Fort Bolton, but paid no attention
to the pleasant good-night he wished them as
he rolled himself up in his blankets preparatory to
going to sleep.</p>

<p>That was the last comfortable night that Chase
passed for more than a week.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="small">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Chase</span> was awakened the next morning by the
crackling of the fire which the hunters had
replenished at daylight. He started up with a
cheery “good-morning” on his lips, but no sooner
was he fairly awake, than a sight caught his eyes
which arrested the words ere they were spoken.
The men, having finished their breakfast, were
overhauling his bundle&mdash;or rather one of them was,
while the other sat by smoking his pipe and looking
at him. Chase found, too, that the blanket which
had covered him during the night, had been pulled
off, and was now rolled up and tied to the horn of
one of the saddles.</p>

<p>“I am to be robbed, I can see that plainly
enough,” said Chase, his heart sinking within him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
“I have been afraid of it all along, and it has come
at last. I might as well give up now. But if I am
to lose all my things, I’ll at least have a breakfast
in part payment,” he added, after a moment’s reflection.</p>

<p>The men looked at Chase as he got up, but did
not speak to him. He took down the haunch of
venison, and while he was cutting off a portion of it,
the hunter who was examining his bundle, coolly
rolled up the blanket from which he had just arisen,
and laid it down beside his saddle. Chase shivered
as he watched the operation, and thought of the
nights he had yet to pass in the mountains, but said
nothing. He thrust some sticks through the slices
of venison, and proceeded to roast them over the
flames.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said the hunter, who had done the
most of the talking the night before, “whar’s them
shiners?”</p>

<p>Chase, holding his breakfast with one hand,
emptied his pocket with the other, giving up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
hard-earned wages without a word of remonstrance.</p>

<p>“Be these all you’ve got?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“Every cent. If you don’t believe it, you can go
through me.”</p>

<p>The man took him at his word, turning all his
pockets inside out, passing his hand around his
neck to make sure that he did not carry a purse
suspended beneath his shirt, and even feeling of the
seams of his trowsers and jacket. Having satisfied
himself that the boy had told the truth, he ordered
him to pull off his boots. Chase obeyed, shaking
each one as he did so, to show that there was nothing
in it.</p>

<p>“O, I know you hain’t got no more money,” said
the man, impatiently. “Hand them boots here.
They’re too big for you, an’ mebbe they’ll fit me.”</p>

<p>“Now you are not barbarian enough to turn me
adrift in this wilderness at this time of the year
barefooted, are you?” cried Chase, in great alarm.</p>

<p>“You cook that grub o’ your’n, an’ let it stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
your mouth; that’s the best thing you can do,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>Chase thought so too. The savage look on the
man’s face frightened him, and he told himself that
he would not object again, no matter what they did
to him.</p>

<p>The hunter pulled off his moccasins and proceeded
to draw on Chase’s boots, which, contrary to the
boy’s hopes, fitted him as if they had been made for
him. He grunted out his satisfaction, and picking up
his moccasins was about to toss them to Chase, when
his companion interposed. “Hand ’em here,” said
he. “I reckon I can use ’em as well as anybody.”</p>

<p>The hunter accordingly passed the moccasins to
his friend, who drew them on over his own, and
Chase settled back on the ground with a despairing
sigh. He was to be left barefooted, sure enough.</p>

<p>The men having appropriated every article of
value that Chase possessed (fortunately they did
not think his pocket-knife and the contents of his
bundle worth stealing), brought up their horses, and
while one put the saddles on them, the other employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
himself in gathering their luggage together,
not even forgetting what remained of the haunch of
venison, which Chase hoped they would leave behind
them. When all was ready for the start, they
mounted and one rode off at once, while the other
stopped to say a parting word to the boy. “No
follerin’ now,” he exclaimed, savagely. “If we
set eyes on you agin, you won’t get off so easy.”</p>

<p>The hunter then rode on after his companion, and
Chase was left alone. So stunned and bewildered
was he that he could scarcely realize his situation.
Hardly knowing what he was about, he replenished
the fire, cooked and ate his slices of venison, and
then picking up the only extra shirt he possessed,
set to work to cut it into strips, so that he could
make of it some protection for his feet. He could
not stay there and starve while he had the strength
to move, and neither could he travel barefooted over
those frosty stones. Having wrapped up his feet
as well as he could, he bundled up his clothes and
resumed his journey.</p>

<p>In after life, Chase was never able to tell just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
what happened during the two weeks following the
night he spent in the hunters’ camp. He knew that
he lived through them, and that was all he did know.
During all this time he was lost&mdash;there was not a
road or a path to be found anywhere. While daylight
lasted he picked his way wearily over logs and
rocks and through tangled thickets, and at night
sat beside his lonely fire, shivering with the cold
and thinking of home. Fortunately he had a flint
and steel and an abundance of tinder, and fortunately,
too, grouse were plenty and he knew how to
snare them, so that he never suffered for want of
food. The clothing in his bundle was gradually
used up for protection for his feet, and he had not
yet been able to make up his mind what he would
do when the last piece was gone.</p>

<p>One day he found himself standing on the brink
of a precipice overlooking a valley, about ten miles
in circumference. In attempting to work his way to
the bottom he missed his footing and fell, bruising
himself severely and tearing his clothing almost into
shreds. He had a roasted grouse in each hand, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
which he held fast; and when he had rested a few
minutes, leaning against the boulder which had
stopped him in his descent, he arose and struggled
forward again. After some trouble he succeeded
in finding an outlet to the valley, which was a
rocky gorge running between lofty mountains. He
camped in the mouth of this gorge, and on the
afternoon of the next day found himself within
sight of the prairie. His hopes rose a moment,
and then sank to zero again. There were no more
mountains and gullies to be passed, but there was
many a mile of prairie to be traversed, and he was
in just as much danger of being hopelessly bewildered
and lost, as he had been at any time during
his journey. While he was thinking about it, he
came suddenly around a tall rock, which jutted out
into the gorge like a promontory into the ocean, and
was brought to a stand-still by an unexpected sight.
A drove of horses were on the point of entering the
gorge. They were close upon him, and Chase, to
save himself from being run down by them, sprang
quickly behind the nearest tree. The horses saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
him and swerved from their course, and at the same
time Chase heard some words addressed to him by a
horseman who was riding in the rear of the drove.
He was sure the words were addressed to him, for
the horseman looked straight toward him, and,
more than that, he raised his hand and shook
something at him. It was the first time for many a
long day that Chase had heard the sound of a
human voice, but it was not a welcome sound, for
he thought he recognised the horseman. It was
one of the hunters who had robbed him. Remembering
the parting threat they had uttered, Chase
turned and retreated up the hill with all possible
speed. Before he reached the top he heard the
horses rushing down the gorge, and then the sound
of voices came to his ears. No doubt the hunters
believed that he had followed them, and were about
to hunt him up and do something terrible to him.
Frightened at the thought, Chase crept away and
hid himself in a hollow log, from which he never
ventured out again until long after dark.</p>

<p>The week following this incident was another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
memorable one to the wanderer. He was lost
again. The mountains were full of gullies, which
crossed and recrossed one another in every direction,
and he could not find the prairie. He knew which
way he ought to go, for the sun told him; but none
of the gullies ran that way, and their sides were
much too steep to be scaled. Turn which way he
would, nothing but rocks and stunted trees met his
gaze.</p>

<p>Finally the last bone of the last grouse he had
snared was picked clean and thrown away, and
for the first time Chase began to suffer from the
pangs of hunger. That same day, too, something
came which he had long been dreading&mdash;a snow-storm.
It was wonderful how rapidly it increased
in violence when it was once fairly started! The
wind which roared up the gorges could not have
been colder if it had come off some of the icebergs
he had seen in going around Cape Horn, and he had
never in his life seen so much snow as he saw during
the next few hours. Drifts began to show themselves.
Some of them were a foot or more in depth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
and when Chase waded through them, he felt the
snow settling around his bare ankles. That took
all the courage out of him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I shall do now,” said he,
almost ready to abandon himself to despair. “I’m
snowed up. It will be of no use for me to try to
find the prairie now, for I would not dare go out
there; and if I stay here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Chase suddenly stopped, faced quickly about and
made an effort to take to his heels, but the bundle
of cloths which he wore on his feet impeded his progress,
tripped him up and he went down in a snowdrift.
Scrambling up with all possible haste, he
wiped the snow out of his eyes, and took a survey
of the objects that had excited his alarm. There
was no one in sight; but there was a smouldering
fire under the cliffs, two wagons in the road, one
with a broken axletree, two mules lying dead in the
harness, an ox lying dead in his yoke, and the
remains of another, which had been butchered, close
by him. There were plenty of footprints about, and
the persons who made them could not have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
long absent, for the snow, which constantly sifted
down from the bluffs above, had not yet filled them
entirely up.</p>

<p>“They’re gone!” said Chase, looking all around,
“and even if they should come back and should
prove to be enemies, they could not have the heart
to refuse me something to eat. The men who
robbed me gave me a supper and breakfast.”</p>

<p>Encouraged by these thoughts, Chase drew near
and looked into both the wagons, examined the
footprints, to see whether those who made them
were white men or Indians, and then raking the
coals together and blowing them into a blaze with
his hat, piled on some wood that happened to be
lying near, and went to the slaughtered ox to select
a piece of meat for his dinner.</p>

<p>“Something is always happening just in the nick
of time,” said Chase, as he turned the piece of
meat before the fire. “My affairs may take a turn
for the better yet. I noticed a pair of boots in one
of those wagons&mdash;pretty well worn, it is true, but
much better than what I have been wearing during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
the last three weeks, and also some clothing that
will perhaps be more comfortable than this I have
on. I hope the owners will not return until I have
had time to make a selection from their store. It
is always darkest just before daylight.”</p>

<p>Yes, and Chase’s day was just on the point of
dawning. While he was talking thus with himself,
the sound of footsteps in the snow caused him to
look up in alarm. There was a party approaching,
but there was nothing in the appearance of those
who composed it to induce Chase to flee from them.
He felt more like running to meet them. The new-comers
were the Pike and his family. The old man
led the way with a bundle thrown over his shoulder,
and a child on each arm. He seemed surprised to
see Chase, but was as profuse in his offers of hospitality
as he had been when Archie Winters and his
two companions first entered his camp.</p>

<p>“How do, stranger?” said he, cheerfully. “Making
yourself to home, eh? That’s right. It
hain’t much we’ve got to offer now, but you’re as
welcome as the flowers of May.”</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>“Is this your property, sir?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it is all I have left of what I brought
with me from the States.”</p>

<p>“You have met with an accident?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and been robbed!”</p>

<p>“By Indians?”</p>

<p>“No; by white men!”</p>

<p>“I was served the same way,” said Chase, in
alarm. “I hope they have gone away.”</p>

<p>“O, yes. They’ve taken all that is worth stealing,
and there is no fear that they will come back.
But they left me this,” said the Pike, patting his
bundle as he placed it carefully on the ground,
“and I can soon replace what I have lost. I’ve
got a million dollars here.”</p>

<p>“Why, I should think they would have taken it
from you,” said Chase, looking doubtfully at the
man and wondering if he was in his right mind.</p>

<p>“It would have been of no use to them&mdash;that’s
the reason they didn’t take it.”</p>

<p>Chase glanced at the Pike’s wife and children,
who ranged themselves on the opposite side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
fire without saying a word, and then turned his
attention to the man himself, who began undoing
his bundle, finally disclosing to view the machine
which was to run his quartz-mill when he reached
his gold-mine in the mountains. Chase, unable to
make out what it was, asked some questions concerning
it, but the Pike was too busy to reply.
Reuben, with whom he next tried to be sociable,
didn’t want to talk or didn’t know how; but the
woman had a tongue and it was a matter of no
difficulty to set it going.</p>

<p>While Chase was eating his meat, and listening
to her story of the adventures that had lately befallen
herself and family, another party approached the
camp-fire&mdash;three boys about Chase’s own age, who
came plodding along through the snow with bundles
thrown over their shoulders. They looked at Chase
in great amazement, and one of them said, in a voice
which he meant should be audible only to his companions,
but whose shrill, piping tones nevertheless
reached the wanderer’s ear and set his heart to
beating like a trip-hammer&mdash;</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<p>“Hallo! who is this stranger, and where did the
Pike pick him up?”</p>

<p>The boys behind looked over their leader’s shoulder
to see who the stranger was, and Chase heard one
of them exclaim: “I declare, that’s the Wild Man
of the Woods, fellows! He’s the one who frightened
the horses!”</p>

<p>As the three boys drew nearer Chase’s heart continued
to beat loudly, and his eyes began to open
with amazement. He looked again and again,
brushing away a mist that appeared to obstruct his
vision, and then sat as motionless as if he had been
turned into one of the boulders that lay scattered
around. He noticed, too, that something created a
commotion among the approaching boys. The one
in front uttered an exclamation that quickly brought
the one in the rear to his side, and the two stood
looking first at Chase, then at each other, and
whispering eagerly. At length one of them called
out abruptly:</p>

<p>“Say, fellow, who are you?”</p>

<p>“O, Eugene!” was all poor Chase could say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
He had borne up bravely so far, but he could bear
up no longer. To hear the tones of a familiar and
kindly voice out there in that wilderness, when he
had thought himself a thousand miles from everybody
he had ever seen or heard of, was too much for
the wanderer in his demoralized condition. He
leaned his hands upon his knees, buried his face in
them and sobbed convulsively.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> Hank, as sure as the world!” cried both
Fred and Eugene, in tones which showed that they
were not quite ready to believe it after all.</p>

<p>They dropped their bundles, and hurrying up to
the long lost boy threw themselves down one on each
side of him. “Look up, Hank,” said Eugene,
“and let us see if it is really you. Speak to a
fellow, can’t you?”</p>

<p>But Chase could neither look up nor speak. His
tears flowed freely as he rocked himself back and
forth on the ground. His two friends glanced at
his tattered clothing, at the rags which covered his
feet, then at his blue cold hands, and the eyes they
raised to Archie Winters’s astonished face were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
dry by any means. Fred nodded his head toward
one of the bundles, and Archie understanding the
sign, quickly untied it, and handed out a pair of
blankets which Fred and Eugene threw over Chase’s
shivering form, and then patiently waited for him to
speak, resting their arms over his shoulders meanwhile,
as if to assure him of their protection.</p>

<p>“He is a friend of ours,” said Featherweight, in
answer to an inquiring look from the Pike and his
wife. “He lives near us in Louisiana, and used to
go to school with us.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do think in my soul!” cried the worthy
couple, in concert.</p>

<p>“Yes. The last time we saw him was in Cuba,
and how he ever came out here is a mystery.”</p>

<p>And of course it remained a mystery until Chase
was ready to explain, which he did as soon as he
was warmed up both inside and out. A cup of hot
coffee (fortunately there proved to be enough of the
coffee-pot left to serve the purpose for which it was
originally intended), a roaring fire, the substitution
of a pair of stockings and boots for the insufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
protection his feet had known during the last few
days, and, better than all, the knowledge that he
was among friends again, worked a wonderful change
in the wanderer. Every one about the fire listened
eagerly while he related the story of his trials, and
when he concluded, Eugene told what had happened
to the Sportsman’s Club since they had last seen
Chase in Cuba; so that it was long after midnight
before a wink of sleep was had about that fire by any
but the Pike’s children.</p>

<p>Hemlock boughs for beds and wood for the fire
were plenty; so were blankets, such as they were;
the overhanging cliff protected them from the storm;
and Chase once more slept soundly and without suffering
from the cold. The next day the boys all
went out to the mouth of the gorge to see if there
were any signs of their friends, and Archie added
that sentence to the notice he had already written
on the beech tree. It would have been nearer correct
had he written it: “Chase has found us.”</p>

<p>The very next day the looked-for help arrived,
and then there was a jubilee indeed! Chase’s story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
had to be told all over again, and it lost nothing in
the telling, for those who had already heard it were
just as much interested in it as were the new-comers.
No less interesting to Frank, Walter and the rest
of the Club, was the history of the exploits that
Archie and his two companions had performed since
leaving Fort Bolton. They had actually succeeded
in capturing the wild horse, and it was through no
fault or mismanagement of their own that they had
lost him. Of course everybody sympathized with
them, and Archie was the hero of the hour.</p>

<p>The storm abated that night, and early the next
morning preparations were made to return to the
Fort. Dick and old Bob superintended the work,
and in a very short space of time their horses, which
had never worn a collar before, were harnessed to
the uninjured wagon; and when Chase, and the
Pike and all his belongings, had been put into it,
the journey was commenced. It lasted four days,
but the travellers enjoyed themselves in spite of the
cold weather that set in after the storm.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>Chase remained at the Fort only one day&mdash;just
long enough to provide himself with suitable clothing;
and when Uncle Dick had furnished him with
funds enough to bear all his expenses, the Club
went down to the station to see him started on his
way home. A happier or more grateful boy than
Chase was that day never lived. The Club often
heard of him after that. While they were prosecuting
their voyage around the world, he and Wilson
were attending the Bellville Academy&mdash;the new
buildings having been completed by this time,&mdash;and
they made it a point to keep their friends on board
the Stranger posted in all that went on there.</p>

<p>Having seen Chase off, and the Pike and his
family settled for the winter in comfortable quarters
near the Fort, the Club began active preparations for
their journey across the mountains. Old Winter
had only just “shown his teeth,” so Dick Lewis said.
The roads were not yet impassable, but soon would
be, and if the journey to San Francisco was to be
made that winter, it must be undertaken at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
So the Club started without delay, Dick and old Bob
acting as guides. Of the adventures that befell

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
